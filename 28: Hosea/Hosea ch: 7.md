# Hosea 7

**1** ¶ When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, [and] the troop of robbers spoileth without.

**2** And they consider not in their hearts [that] I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.

**3** They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.

**4** They [are] all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, [who] ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.

**5** In the day of our king the princes have made [him] sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.

**6** For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.

**7** They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: [there is] none among them that calleth unto me.

**8** ¶ Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.

**9** Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth [it] not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.

**10** And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.

**11** Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.

**12** When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.

**13** Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.

**14** And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, [and] they rebel against me.

**15** Though I have bound [and] strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.

**16** They return, [but] not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this [shall be] their derision in the land of Egypt.
