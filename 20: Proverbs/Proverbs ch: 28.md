# Proverbs 28

**1** ¶ The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.

**2** ¶ For the transgression of a land many [are] the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding [and] knowledge the state [thereof] shall be prolonged.

**3** ¶ A poor man that oppresseth the poor [is like] a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.

**4** ¶ They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.

**5** ¶ Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all [things].

**6** ¶ Better [is] the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than [he that is] perverse [in his] ways, though he [be] rich.

**7** ¶ Whoso keepeth the law [is] a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous [men] shameth his father.

**8** ¶ He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.

**9** ¶ He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer [shall be] abomination.

**10** ¶ Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good [things] in possession.

**11** ¶ The rich man [is] wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.

**12** ¶ When righteous [men] do rejoice, [there is] great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.

**13** ¶ He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh [them] shall have mercy.

**14** ¶ Happy [is] the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.

**15** ¶ [As] a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; [so is] a wicked ruler over the poor people.

**16** ¶ The prince that wanteth understanding [is] also a great oppressor: [but] he that hateth covetousness shall prolong [his] days.

**17** ¶ A man that doeth violence to the blood of [any] person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.

**18** ¶ Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but [he that is] perverse [in his] ways shall fall at once.

**19** ¶ He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain [persons] shall have poverty enough.

**20** ¶ A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.

**21** ¶ To have respect of persons [is] not good: for for a piece of bread [that] man will transgress.

**22** ¶ He that hasteth to be rich [hath] an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.

**23** ¶ He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.

**24** ¶ Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, [It is] no transgression; the same [is] the companion of a destroyer.

**25** ¶ He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.

**26** ¶ He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.

**27** ¶ He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.

**28** ¶ When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
