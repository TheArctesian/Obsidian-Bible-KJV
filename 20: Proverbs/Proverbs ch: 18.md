# Proverbs 18

**1** ¶ Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh [and] intermeddleth with all wisdom.

**2** ¶ A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.

**3** ¶ When the wicked cometh, [then] cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.

**4** ¶ The words of a man's mouth [are as] deep waters, [and] the wellspring of wisdom [as] a flowing brook.

**5** ¶ [It is] not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.

**6** ¶ A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.

**7** A fool's mouth [is] his destruction, and his lips [are] the snare of his soul.

**8** ¶ The words of a talebearer [are] as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.

**9** ¶ He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.

**10** ¶ The name of the LORD [is] a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.

**11** ¶ The rich man's wealth [is] his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.

**12** ¶ Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour [is] humility.

**13** ¶ He that answereth a matter before he heareth [it], it [is] folly and shame unto him.

**14** ¶ The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?

**15** ¶ The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.

**16** ¶ A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.

**17** ¶ [He that is] first in his own cause [seemeth] just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.

**18** ¶ The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.

**19** ¶ A brother offended [is harder to be won] than a strong city: and [their] contentions [are] like the bars of a castle.

**20** ¶ A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; [and] with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.

**21** ¶ Death and life [are] in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.

**22** ¶ [Whoso] findeth a wife findeth a good [thing], and obtaineth favour of the LORD.

**23** ¶ The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.

**24** ¶ A man [that hath] friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend [that] sticketh closer than a brother.
