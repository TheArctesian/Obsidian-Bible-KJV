# Proverbs 29

**1** ¶ He, that being often reproved hardeneth [his] neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.

**2** ¶ When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.

**3** ¶ Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth [his] substance.

**4** ¶ The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.

**5** ¶ A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.

**6** ¶ In the transgression of an evil man [there is] a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.

**7** ¶ The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: [but] the wicked regardeth not to know [it].

**8** ¶ Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise [men] turn away wrath.

**9** ¶ [If] a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, [there is] no rest.

**10** ¶ The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.

**11** ¶ A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise [man] keepeth it in till afterwards.

**12** ¶ If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants [are] wicked.

**13** ¶ The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.

**14** ¶ The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.

**15** ¶ The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left [to himself] bringeth his mother to shame.

**16** ¶ When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.

**17** ¶ Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.

**18** ¶ Where [there is] no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy [is] he.

**19** ¶ A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.

**20** ¶ Seest thou a man [that is] hasty in his words? [there is] more hope of a fool than of him.

**21** ¶ He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become [his] son at the length.

**22** ¶ An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.

**23** ¶ A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.

**24** ¶ Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth [it] not.

**25** ¶ The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.

**26** ¶ Many seek the ruler's favour; but [every] man's judgment [cometh] from the LORD.

**27** ¶ An unjust man [is] an abomination to the just: and [he that is] upright in the way [is] abomination to the wicked.
