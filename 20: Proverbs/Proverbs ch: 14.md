# Proverbs 14

**1** ¶ Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.

**2** ¶ He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but [he that is] perverse in his ways despiseth him.

**3** ¶ In the mouth of the foolish [is] a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.

**4** ¶ Where no oxen [are], the crib [is] clean: but much increase [is] by the strength of the ox.

**5** ¶ A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.

**6** ¶ A scorner seeketh wisdom, and [findeth it] not: but knowledge [is] easy unto him that understandeth.

**7** ¶ Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not [in him] the lips of knowledge.

**8** ¶ The wisdom of the prudent [is] to understand his way: but the folly of fools [is] deceit.

**9** ¶ Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous [there is] favour.

**10** ¶ The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.

**11** ¶ The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.

**12** ¶ There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof [are] the ways of death.

**13** ¶ Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth [is] heaviness.

**14** ¶ The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man [shall be satisfied] from himself.

**15** ¶ The simple believeth every word: but the prudent [man] looketh well to his going.

**16** ¶ A wise [man] feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.

**17** ¶ [He that is] soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.

**18** ¶ The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.

**19** ¶ The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.

**20** ¶ The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich [hath] many friends.

**21** ¶ He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy [is] he.

**22** ¶ Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth [shall be] to them that devise good.

**23** ¶ In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips [tendeth] only to penury.

**24** ¶ The crown of the wise [is] their riches: [but] the foolishness of fools [is] folly.

**25** ¶ A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful [witness] speaketh lies.

**26** ¶ In the fear of the LORD [is] strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.

**27** The fear of the LORD [is] a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.

**28** ¶ In the multitude of people [is] the king's honour: but in the want of people [is] the destruction of the prince.

**29** ¶ [He that is] slow to wrath [is] of great understanding: but [he that is] hasty of spirit exalteth folly.

**30** ¶ A sound heart [is] the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.

**31** ¶ He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.

**32** ¶ The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.

**33** ¶ Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but [that which is] in the midst of fools is made known.

**34** ¶ Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin [is] a reproach to any people.

**35** ¶ The king's favour [is] toward a wise servant: but his wrath is [against] him that causeth shame.
