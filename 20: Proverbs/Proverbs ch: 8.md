# Proverbs 8

**1** ¶ Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?

**2** She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.

**3** She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.

**4** Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice [is] to the sons of man.

**5** O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.

**6** Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips [shall be] right things.

**7** For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness [is] an abomination to my lips.

**8** All the words of my mouth [are] in righteousness; [there is] nothing froward or perverse in them.

**9** They [are] all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.

**10** Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.

**11** For wisdom [is] better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.

**12** ¶ I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.

**13** The fear of the LORD [is] to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.

**14** Counsel [is] mine, and sound wisdom: I [am] understanding; I have strength.

**15** By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.

**16** By me princes rule, and nobles, [even] all the judges of the earth.

**17** I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.

**18** Riches and honour [are] with me; [yea], durable riches and righteousness.

**19** My fruit [is] better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.

**20** I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:

**21** That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.

**22** ¶ The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.

**23** I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.

**24** When [there were] no depths, I was brought forth; when [there were] no fountains abounding with water.

**25** Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:

**26** While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.

**27** When he prepared the heavens, I [was] there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:

**28** When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:

**29** When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:

**30** Then I was by him, [as] one brought up [with him]: and I was daily [his] delight, rejoicing always before him;

**31** Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights [were] with the sons of men.

**32** ¶ Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed [are they that] keep my ways.

**33** Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.

**34** Blessed [is] the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

**35** For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.

**36** But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
