# Proverbs 21

**1** ¶ The king's heart [is] in the hand of the LORD, [as] the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.

**2** ¶ Every way of a man [is] right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.

**3** ¶ To do justice and judgment [is] more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.

**4** ¶ An high look, and a proud heart, [and] the plowing of the wicked, [is] sin.

**5** ¶ The thoughts of the diligent [tend] only to plenteousness; but of every one [that is] hasty only to want.

**6** ¶ The getting of treasures by a lying tongue [is] a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.

**7** ¶ The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.

**8** ¶ The way of man [is] froward and strange: but [as for] the pure, his work [is] right.

**9** ¶ [It is] better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.

**10** ¶ The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.

**11** ¶ When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.

**12** ¶ The righteous [man] wisely considereth the house of the wicked: [but God] overthroweth the wicked for [their] wickedness.

**13** ¶ Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.

**14** ¶ A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.

**15** ¶ [It is] joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction [shall be] to the workers of iniquity.

**16** ¶ The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.

**17** ¶ He that loveth pleasure [shall be] a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.

**18** ¶ The wicked [shall be] a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.

**19** ¶ [It is] better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.

**20** ¶ [There is] treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.

**21** ¶ He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.

**22** ¶ A wise [man] scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.

**23** ¶ Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.

**24** ¶ Proud [and] haughty scorner [is] his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.

**25** ¶ The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.

**26** He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.

**27** ¶ The sacrifice of the wicked [is] abomination: how much more, [when] he bringeth it with a wicked mind?

**28** ¶ A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.

**29** ¶ A wicked man hardeneth his face: but [as for] the upright, he directeth his way.

**30** ¶ [There is] no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.

**31** The horse [is] prepared against the day of battle: but safety [is] of the LORD.
