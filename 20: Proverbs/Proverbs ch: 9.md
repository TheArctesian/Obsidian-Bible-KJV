# Proverbs 9

**1** ¶ Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:

**2** She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.

**3** She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,

**4** Whoso [is] simple, let him turn in hither: [as for] him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

**5** Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine [which] I have mingled.

**6** Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.

**7** He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked [man getteth] himself a blot.

**8** Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.

**9** Give [instruction] to a wise [man], and he will be yet wiser: teach a just [man], and he will increase in learning.

**10** The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy [is] understanding.

**11** For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.

**12** If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but [if] thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear [it].

**13** ¶ A foolish woman [is] clamorous: [she is] simple, and knoweth nothing.

**14** For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,

**15** To call passengers who go right on their ways:

**16** Whoso [is] simple, let him turn in hither: and [as for] him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

**17** Stolen waters are sweet, and bread [eaten] in secret is pleasant.

**18** But he knoweth not that the dead [are] there; [and that] her guests [are] in the depths of hell.
