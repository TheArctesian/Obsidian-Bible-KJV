# Proverbs 5

**1** ¶ My son, attend unto my wisdom, [and] bow thine ear to my understanding:

**2** That thou mayest regard discretion, and [that] thy lips may keep knowledge.

**3** For the lips of a strange woman drop [as] an honeycomb, and her mouth [is] smoother than oil:

**4** But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.

**5** Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

**6** Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, [that] thou canst not know [them].

**7** Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.

**8** Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:

**9** Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:

**10** Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours [be] in the house of a stranger;

**11** And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,

**12** And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;

**13** And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!

**14** I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.

**15** ¶ Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.

**16** Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, [and] rivers of waters in the streets.

**17** Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.

**18** Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.

**19** [Let her be as] the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.

**20** And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?

**21** For the ways of man [are] before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.

**22** His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.

**23** He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
