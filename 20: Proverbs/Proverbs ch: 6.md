# Proverbs 6

**1** ¶ My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, [if] thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,

**2** Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.

**3** Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.

**4** Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

**5** Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand [of the hunter], and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.

**6** ¶ Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:

**7** Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,

**8** Provideth her meat in the summer, [and] gathereth her food in the harvest.

**9** How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?

**10** [Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:

**11** So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.

**12** ¶ A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.

**13** He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;

**14** Frowardness [is] in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.

**15** Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.

**16** These six [things] doth the LORD hate: yea, seven [are] an abomination unto him:

**17** A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,

**18** An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,

**19** A false witness [that] speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.

**20** ¶ My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:

**21** Bind them continually upon thine heart, [and] tie them about thy neck.

**22** When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and [when] thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.

**23** For the commandment [is] a lamp; and the law [is] light; and reproofs of instruction [are] the way of life:

**24** To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.

**25** Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.

**26** For by means of a whorish woman [a man is brought] to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.

**27** Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?

**28** Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

**29** So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.

**30** [Men] do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;

**31** But [if] he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.

**32** [But] whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he [that] doeth it destroyeth his own soul.

**33** A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.

**34** For jealousy [is] the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.

**35** He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
