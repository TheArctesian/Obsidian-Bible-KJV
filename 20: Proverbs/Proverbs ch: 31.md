# Proverbs 31

**1** ¶ The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.

**2** What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?

**3** Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.

**4** [It is] not for kings, O Lemuel, [it is] not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:

**5** Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.

**6** Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.

**7** Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.

**8** Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.

**9** Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.

**10** ¶ Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price [is] far above rubies.

**11** The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.

**12** She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.

**13** She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.

**14** She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.

**15** She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.

**16** She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.

**17** She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.

**18** She perceiveth that her merchandise [is] good: her candle goeth not out by night.

**19** She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.

**20** She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.

**21** She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household [are] clothed with scarlet.

**22** She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing [is] silk and purple.

**23** Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.

**24** She maketh fine linen, and selleth [it]; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.

**25** Strength and honour [are] her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.

**26** She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue [is] the law of kindness.

**27** She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.

**28** Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband [also], and he praiseth her.

**29** Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.

**30** Favour [is] deceitful, and beauty [is] vain: [but] a woman [that] feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.

**31** Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
