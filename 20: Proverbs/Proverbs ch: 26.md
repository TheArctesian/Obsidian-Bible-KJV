# Proverbs 26

**1** ¶ As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.

**2** ¶ As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.

**3** ¶ A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.

**4** ¶ Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.

**5** Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.

**6** ¶ He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, [and] drinketh damage.

**7** The legs of the lame are not equal: so [is] a parable in the mouth of fools.

**8** As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so [is] he that giveth honour to a fool.

**9** [As] a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so [is] a parable in the mouth of fools.

**10** ¶ The great [God] that formed all [things] both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.

**11** ¶ As a dog returneth to his vomit, [so] a fool returneth to his folly.

**12** ¶ Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? [there is] more hope of a fool than of him.

**13** ¶ The slothful [man] saith, [There is] a lion in the way; a lion [is] in the streets.

**14** ¶ [As] the door turneth upon his hinges, so [doth] the slothful upon his bed.

**15** ¶ The slothful hideth his hand in [his] bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.

**16** ¶ The sluggard [is] wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.

**17** ¶ He that passeth by, [and] meddleth with strife [belonging] not to him, [is like] one that taketh a dog by the ears.

**18** ¶ As a mad [man] who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,

**19** So [is] the man [that] deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?

**20** ¶ Where no wood is, [there] the fire goeth out: so where [there is] no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.

**21** [As] coals [are] to burning coals, and wood to fire; so [is] a contentious man to kindle strife.

**22** The words of a talebearer [are] as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.

**23** ¶ Burning lips and a wicked heart [are like] a potsherd covered with silver dross.

**24** ¶ He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;

**25** When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for [there are] seven abominations in his heart.

**26** [Whose] hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the [whole] congregation.

**27** ¶ Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.

**28** ¶ A lying tongue hateth [those that are] afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
