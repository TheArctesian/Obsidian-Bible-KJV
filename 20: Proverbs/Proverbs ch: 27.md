# Proverbs 27

**1** ¶ Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.

**2** ¶ Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.

**3** ¶ A stone [is] heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath [is] heavier than them both.

**4** Wrath [is] cruel, and anger [is] outrageous; but who [is] able to stand before envy?

**5** ¶ Open rebuke [is] better than secret love.

**6** Faithful [are] the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy [are] deceitful.

**7** ¶ The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.

**8** ¶ As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so [is] a man that wandereth from his place.

**9** ¶ Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so [doth] the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.

**10** Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: [for] better [is] a neighbour [that is] near than a brother far off.

**11** ¶ My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.

**12** ¶ A prudent [man] foreseeth the evil, [and] hideth himself; [but] the simple pass on, [and] are punished.

**13** ¶ Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.

**14** ¶ He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.

**15** ¶ A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.

**16** Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, [which] bewrayeth [itself].

**17** ¶ Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.

**18** ¶ Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.

**19** ¶ As in water face [answereth] to face, so the heart of man to man.

**20** ¶ Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.

**21** ¶ [As] the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so [is] a man to his praise.

**22** ¶ Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, [yet] will not his foolishness depart from him.

**23** ¶ Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, [and] look well to thy herds.

**24** For riches [are] not for ever: and doth the crown [endure] to every generation?

**25** The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.

**26** The lambs [are] for thy clothing, and the goats [are] the price of the field.

**27** And [thou shalt have] goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and [for] the maintenance for thy maidens.
