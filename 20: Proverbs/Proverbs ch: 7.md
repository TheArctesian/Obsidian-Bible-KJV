# Proverbs 7

**1** ¶ My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

**2** Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.

**3** Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.

**4** Say unto wisdom, Thou [art] my sister; and call understanding [thy] kinswoman:

**5** That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger [which] flattereth with her words.

**6** ¶ For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

**7** And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,

**8** Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,

**9** In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:

**10** And, behold, there met him a woman [with] the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.

**11** (She [is] loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

**12** Now [is she] without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)

**13** So she caught him, and kissed him, [and] with an impudent face said unto him,

**14** [I have] peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.

**15** Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.

**16** I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved [works], with fine linen of Egypt.

**17** I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

**18** Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.

**19** For the goodman [is] not at home, he is gone a long journey:

**20** He hath taken a bag of money with him, [and] will come home at the day appointed.

**21** With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.

**22** He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;

**23** Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it [is] for his life.

**24** ¶ Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.

**25** Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.

**26** For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong [men] have been slain by her.

**27** Her house [is] the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
