# 1 Corinthians 11

**1** ¶ Be ye followers of me, even as I also [am] of Christ.

**2** Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered [them] to you.

**3** But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman [is] the man; and the head of Christ [is] God.

**4** Every man praying or prophesying, having [his] head covered, dishonoureth his head.

**5** But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with [her] head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.

**6** For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.

**7** For a man indeed ought not to cover [his] head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.

**8** For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.

**9** Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.

**10** For this cause ought the woman to have power on [her] head because of the angels.

**11** Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.

**12** For as the woman [is] of the man, even so [is] the man also by the woman; but all things of God.

**13** Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?

**14** Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?

**15** But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for [her] hair is given her for a covering.

**16** But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.

**17** ¶ Now in this that I declare [unto you] I praise [you] not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.

**18** For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.

**19** For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.

**20** When ye come together therefore into one place, [this] is not to eat the Lord's supper.

**21** For in eating every one taketh before [other] his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.

**22** What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise [you] not.

**23** ¶ For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the [same] night in which he was betrayed took bread:

**24** And when he had given thanks, he brake [it], and said, ‹Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.›

**25** After the same manner also [he took] the cup, when he had supped, saying, ‹This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink› [it], ‹in remembrance of me.›

**26** For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.

**27** Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink [this] cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

**28** But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread, and drink of [that] cup.

**29** For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.

**30** For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.

**31** For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.

**32** But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.

**33** Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.

**34** And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
