# Ecclesiastes 8

**1** ¶ Who [is] as the wise [man]? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.

**2** I [counsel thee] to keep the king's commandment, and [that] in regard of the oath of God.

**3** Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

**4** Where the word of a king [is, there is] power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?

**5** Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.

**6** ¶ Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man [is] great upon him.

**7** For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?

**8** [There is] no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither [hath he] power in the day of death: and [there is] no discharge in [that] war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.

**9** ¶ All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: [there is] a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.

**10** And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this [is] also vanity.

**11** Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.

**12** Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his [days] be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:

**13** But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong [his] days, [which are] as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.

**14** ¶ There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just [men], unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked [men], to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also [is] vanity.

**15** Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.

**16** When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also [there is that] neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)

**17** Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek [it] out, yet he shall not find [it]; yea further; though a wise [man] think to know [it], yet shall he not be able to find [it].

**1** ¶ O that thou [wert] as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! [when] I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.

**2** I would lead thee, [and] bring thee into my mother's house, [who] would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.

**3** His left hand [should be] under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.

**4** I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake [my] love, until he please.

**5** ¶ Who [is] this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth [that] bare thee.

**6** Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love [is] strong as death; jealousy [is] cruel as the grave: the coals thereof [are] coals of fire, [which hath a] most vehement flame.

**7** Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if [a] man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.

**8** ¶ We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?

**9** If she [be] a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she [be] a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.

**10** I [am] a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.

**11** Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand [pieces] of silver.

**12** My vineyard, which [is] mine, [is] before me: thou, O Solomon, [must have] a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.

**13** ¶ Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear [it].

**14** Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
