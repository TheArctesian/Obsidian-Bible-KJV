# Ecclesiastes 5

**1** ¶ Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.

**2** Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter [any] thing before God: for God [is] in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.

**3** For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice [is known] by multitude of words.

**4** ¶ When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for [he hath] no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.

**5** Better [is it] that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.

**6** Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it [was] an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?

**7** For in the multitude of dreams and many words [there are] also [divers] vanities: but fear thou God.

**8** If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for [he that is] higher than the highest regardeth; and [there be] higher than they.

**9** ¶ Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king [himself] is served by the field.

**10** He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this [is] also vanity.

**11** When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good [is there] to the owners thereof, saving the beholding [of them] with their eyes?

**12** The sleep of a labouring man [is] sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.

**13** There is a sore evil [which] I have seen under the sun, [namely], riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.

**14** But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and [there is] nothing in his hand.

**15** As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.

**16** And this also [is] a sore evil, [that] in all points as he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind?

**17** All his days also he eateth in darkness, and [he hath] much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.

**18** ¶ Behold [that] which I have seen: [it is] good and comely [for one] to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it [is] his portion.

**19** Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this [is] the gift of God.

**20** For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth [him] in the joy of his heart.

**1** ¶ I am come into my garden, my sister, [my] spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.

**2** ¶ I sleep, but my heart waketh: [it is] the voice of my beloved that knocketh, [saying], Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, [and] my locks with the drops of the night.

**3** I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?

**4** My beloved put in his hand by the hole [of the door], and my bowels were moved for him.

**5** I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped [with] myrrh, and my fingers [with] sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.

**6** I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, [and] was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

**7** The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.

**8** I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I [am] sick of love.

**9** ¶ What [is] thy beloved more than [another] beloved, O thou fairest among women? what [is] thy beloved more than [another] beloved, that thou dost so charge us?

**10** My beloved [is] white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.

**11** His head [is as] the most fine gold, his locks [are] bushy, [and] black as a raven.

**12** His eyes [are] as [the eyes] of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, [and] fitly set.

**13** His cheeks [are] as a bed of spices, [as] sweet flowers: his lips [like] lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.

**14** His hands [are as] gold rings set with the beryl: his belly [is as] bright ivory overlaid [with] sapphires.

**15** His legs [are as] pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance [is] as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.

**16** His mouth [is] most sweet: yea, he [is] altogether lovely. This [is] my beloved, and this [is] my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
