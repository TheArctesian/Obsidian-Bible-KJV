# Ecclesiastes 4

**1** ¶ So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of [such as were] oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors [there was] power; but they had no comforter.

**2** Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive.

**3** Yea, better [is he] than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

**4** ¶ Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This [is] also vanity and vexation of spirit.

**5** The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

**6** Better [is] an handful [with] quietness, than both the hands full [with] travail and vexation of spirit.

**7** ¶ Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

**8** There is one [alone], and [there is] not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet [is there] no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither [saith he], For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This [is] also vanity, yea, it [is] a sore travail.

**9** Two [are] better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.

**10** For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him [that is] alone when he falleth; for [he hath] not another to help him up.

**11** Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm [alone]?

**12** And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.

**13** ¶ Better [is] a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.

**14** For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also [he that is] born in his kingdom becometh poor.

**15** I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.

**16** [There is] no end of all the people, [even] of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.

**1** ¶ Behold, thou [art] fair, my love; behold, thou [art] fair; thou [hast] doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair [is] as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.

**2** Thy teeth [are] like a flock [of sheep that are even] shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none [is] barren among them.

**3** Thy lips [are] like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech [is] comely: thy temples [are] like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.

**4** Thy neck [is] like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.

**5** Thy two breasts [are] like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.

**6** Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.

**7** Thou [art] all fair, my love; [there is] no spot in thee.

**8** ¶ Come with me from Lebanon, [my] spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

**9** Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, [my] spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.

**10** How fair is thy love, my sister, [my] spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!

**11** Thy lips, O [my] spouse, drop [as] the honeycomb: honey and milk [are] under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments [is] like the smell of Lebanon.

**12** A garden inclosed [is] my sister, [my] spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.

**13** Thy plants [are] an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,

**14** Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:

**15** ¶ A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.

**16** Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, [that] the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.
