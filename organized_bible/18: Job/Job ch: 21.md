# Job 21

**1** ¶ But Job answered and said,

**2** Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.

**3** Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.

**4** As for me, [is] my complaint to man? and if [it were so], why should not my spirit be troubled?

**5** Mark me, and be astonished, and lay [your] hand upon [your] mouth.

**6** Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.

**7** ¶ Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?

**8** Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.

**9** Their houses [are] safe from fear, neither [is] the rod of God upon them.

**10** Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.

**11** They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.

**12** They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.

**13** They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.

**14** Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.

**15** What [is] the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?

**16** Lo, their good [is] not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

**17** ¶ How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and [how oft] cometh their destruction upon them! [God] distributeth sorrows in his anger.

**18** They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.

**19** God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know [it].

**20** His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

**21** For what pleasure [hath] he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?

**22** Shall [any] teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.

**23** One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.

**24** His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.

**25** And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.

**26** They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.

**27** ¶ Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices [which] ye wrongfully imagine against me.

**28** For ye say, Where [is] the house of the prince? and where [are] the dwelling places of the wicked?

**29** Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,

**30** That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.

**31** Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him [what] he hath done?

**32** Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.

**33** The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as [there are] innumerable before him.

**34** How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
