# Job 40

**1** ¶ Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,

**2** Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct [him]? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.

**3** Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

**4** Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.

**5** Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.

**6** ¶ Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

**7** Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.

**8** Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?

**9** Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?

**10** Deck thyself now [with] majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.

**11** Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one [that is] proud, and abase him.

**12** Look on every one [that is] proud, [and] bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.

**13** Hide them in the dust together; [and] bind their faces in secret.

**14** Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.

**15** ¶ Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.

**16** Lo now, his strength [is] in his loins, and his force [is] in the navel of his belly.

**17** He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.

**18** His bones [are as] strong pieces of brass; his bones [are] like bars of iron.

**19** He [is] the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach [unto him].

**20** Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.

**21** He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.

**22** The shady trees cover him [with] their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.

**23** Behold, he drinketh up a river, [and] hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.

**24** He taketh it with his eyes: [his] nose pierceth through snares.
