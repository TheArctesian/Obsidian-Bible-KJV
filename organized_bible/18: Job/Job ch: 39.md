# Job 39

**1** ¶ Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? [or] canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?

**2** Canst thou number the months [that] they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?

**3** They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.

**4** Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.

**5** Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?

**6** Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.

**7** He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.

**8** The range of the mountains [is] his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.

**9** Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?

**10** Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?

**11** Wilt thou trust him, because his strength [is] great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?

**12** Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather [it into] thy barn?

**13** ¶ [Gavest thou] the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?

**14** Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,

**15** And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.

**16** She is hardened against her young ones, as though [they were] not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;

**17** Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.

**18** What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.

**19** ¶ Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?

**20** Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils [is] terrible.

**21** He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in [his] strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.

**22** He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.

**23** The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.

**24** He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that [it is] the sound of the trumpet.

**25** He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.

**26** ¶ Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, [and] stretch her wings toward the south?

**27** Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?

**28** She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.

**29** From thence she seeketh the prey, [and] her eyes behold afar off.

**30** Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain [are], there [is] she.
