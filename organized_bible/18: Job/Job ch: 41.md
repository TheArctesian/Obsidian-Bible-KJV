# Job 41

**1** ¶ Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord [which] thou lettest down?

**2** Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?

**3** Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft [words] unto thee?

**4** Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?

**5** Wilt thou play with him as [with] a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?

**6** Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?

**7** Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?

**8** Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.

**9** Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not [one] be cast down even at the sight of him?

**10** None [is so] fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?

**11** ¶ Who hath prevented me, that I should repay [him? whatsoever is] under the whole heaven is mine.

**12** I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.

**13** Who can discover the face of his garment? [or] who can come [to him] with his double bridle?

**14** Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth [are] terrible round about.

**15** [His] scales [are his] pride, shut up together [as with] a close seal.

**16** One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.

**17** They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.

**18** By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes [are] like the eyelids of the morning.

**19** Out of his mouth go burning lamps, [and] sparks of fire leap out.

**20** Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as [out] of a seething pot or caldron.

**21** His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.

**22** In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.

**23** The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.

**24** His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether [millstone].

**25** When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.

**26** The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.

**27** He esteemeth iron as straw, [and] brass as rotten wood.

**28** The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.

**29** Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.

**30** Sharp stones [are] under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.

**31** He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.

**32** He maketh a path to shine after him; [one] would think the deep [to be] hoary.

**33** Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.

**34** He beholdeth all high [things]: he [is] a king over all the children of pride.
