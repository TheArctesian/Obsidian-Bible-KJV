# Mark 12

**1** ¶ And he began to speak unto them by parables. ‹A› [certain] ‹man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about› [it], ‹and digged› [a place for] ‹the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.›

**2** ‹And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.›

**3** ‹And they caught› [him], ‹and beat him, and sent› [him] ‹away empty.›

**4** ‹And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded› [him] ‹in the head, and sent› [him] ‹away shamefully handled.›

**5** ‹And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.›

**6** ‹Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.›

**7** ‹But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.›

**8** ‹And they took him, and killed› [him], ‹and cast› [him] ‹out of the vineyard.›

**9** ‹What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.›

**10** ‹And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:›

**11** ‹This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?›

**12** And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.

**13** ¶ And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in [his] words.

**14** And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?

**15** Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, ‹Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see› [it].

**16** And they brought [it]. And he saith unto them, ‹Whose› [is] ‹this image and superscription?› And they said unto him, Caesar's.

**17** And Jesus answering said unto them, ‹Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.› And they marvelled at him.

**18** ¶ Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,

**19** Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave [his] wife [behind him], and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.

**20** Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.

**21** And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.

**22** And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.

**23** In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.

**24** And Jesus answering said unto them, ‹Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?›

**25** ‹For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.›

**26** ‹And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I› [am] ‹the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?›

**27** ‹He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.›

**28** ¶ And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?

**29** And Jesus answered him, ‹The first of all the commandments› [is], ‹Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:›

**30** ‹And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this› [is] ‹the first commandment.›

**31** ‹And the second› [is] ‹like,› [namely] ‹this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.›

**32** And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:

**33** And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love [his] neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.

**34** And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, ‹Thou art not far from the kingdom of God.› And no man after that durst ask him [any question].

**35** ¶ And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, ‹How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?›

**36** ‹For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.›

**37** ‹David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he› [then] ‹his son?› And the common people heard him gladly.

**38** And he said unto them in his doctrine, ‹Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and› [love] ‹salutations in the marketplaces,›

**39** ‹And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:›

**40** ‹Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.›

**41** ¶ And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.

**42** And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.

**43** And he called [unto him] his disciples, and saith unto them, ‹Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:›

**44** ‹For all› [they] ‹did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had,› [even] ‹all her living.›
