# Mark 8

**1** ¶ In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples [unto him], and saith unto them,

**2** ‹I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:›

**3** ‹And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.›

**4** And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these [men] with bread here in the wilderness?

**5** And he asked them, ‹How many loaves have ye?› And they said, Seven.

**6** And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before [them]; and they did set [them] before the people.

**7** And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before [them].

**8** So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken [meat] that was left seven baskets.

**9** And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away.

**10** ¶ And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.

**11** And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.

**12** And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, ‹Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.›

**13** And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.

**14** Now [the disciples] had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.

**15** And he charged them, saying, ‹Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and› [of] ‹the leaven of Herod.›

**16** And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because we have no bread.

**17** And when Jesus knew [it], he saith unto them, ‹Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?›

**18** ‹Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?›

**19** ‹When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?› They say unto him, Twelve.

**20** ‹And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?› And they said, Seven.

**21** And he said unto them, ‹How is it that ye do not understand?›

**22** ¶ And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him.

**23** And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought.

**24** And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.

**25** After that he put [his] hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.

**26** And he sent him away to his house, saying, ‹Neither go into the town, nor tell› [it] ‹to any in the town.›

**27** ¶ And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, ‹Whom do men say that I am?›

**28** And they answered, John the Baptist: but some [say], Elias; and others, One of the prophets.

**29** And he saith unto them, ‹But whom say ye that I am?› And Peter answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.

**30** And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.

**31** And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and [of] the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.

**32** And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.

**33** But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked Peter, saying, ‹Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.›

**34** And when he had called the people [unto him] with his disciples also, he said unto them, ‹Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.›

**35** ‹For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it.›

**36** ‹For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?›

**37** ‹Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?›

**38** ‹Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.›
