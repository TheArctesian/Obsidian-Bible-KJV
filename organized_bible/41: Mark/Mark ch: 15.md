# Mark 15

**1** ¶ And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried [him] away, and delivered [him] to Pilate.

**2** And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, ‹Thou sayest› [it].

**3** And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.

**4** And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.

**5** But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.

**6** Now at [that] feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.

**7** And there was [one] named Barabbas, [which lay] bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.

**8** And the multitude crying aloud began to desire [him to do] as he had ever done unto them.

**9** But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?

**10** For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.

**11** But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.

**12** And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do [unto him] whom ye call the King of the Jews?

**13** And they cried out again, Crucify him.

**14** Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.

**15** ¶ And [so] Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged [him], to be crucified.

**16** And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.

**17** And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his [head],

**18** And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!

**19** And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing [their] knees worshipped him.

**20** And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.

**21** And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.

**22** ¶ And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.

**23** And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received [it] not.

**24** And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.

**25** And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.

**26** And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

**27** And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.

**28** And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.

**29** And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest [it] in three days,

**30** Save thyself, and come down from the cross.

**31** Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.

**32** Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.

**33** ¶ And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.

**34** And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, ‹Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?› which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?

**35** And some of them that stood by, when they heard [it], said, Behold, he calleth Elias.

**36** And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.

**37** And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.

**38** And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.

**39** And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.

**40** There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;

**41** (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.

**42** ¶ And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,

**43** Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.

**44** And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling [unto him] the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.

**45** And when he knew [it] of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.

**46** And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.

**47** And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses beheld where he was laid.
