# Mark 7

**1** ¶ Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.

**2** And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.

**3** For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash [their] hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.

**4** And [when they come] from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, [as] the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.

**5** Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?

**6** He answered and said unto them, ‹Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with› [their] ‹lips, but their heart is far from me.›

**7** ‹Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching› [for] ‹doctrines the commandments of men.›

**8** ‹For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men,› [as] ‹the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.›

**9** And he said unto them, ‹Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.›

**10** ‹For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:›

**11** ‹But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother,› [It is] ‹Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;› [he shall be free].

**12** ‹And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;›

**13** ‹Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.›

**14** And when he had called all the people [unto him], he said unto them, ‹Hearken unto me every one› [of you], ‹and understand:›

**15** ‹There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.›

**16** ‹If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.›

**17** And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.

**18** And he saith unto them, ‹Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man,› [it] ‹cannot defile him;›

**19** ‹Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?›

**20** And he said, ‹That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.›

**21** ‹For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,›

**22** ‹Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:›

**23** ‹All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.›

**24** ¶ And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know [it]: but he could not be hid.

**25** For a [certain] woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:

**26** The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.

**27** But Jesus said unto her, ‹Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast› [it] ‹unto the dogs.›

**28** And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.

**29** And he said unto her, ‹For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.›

**30** And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.

**31** ¶ And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.

**32** And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.

**33** And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;

**34** And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, ‹Ephphatha,› that is, Be opened.

**35** And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.

**36** And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published [it];

**37** And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
