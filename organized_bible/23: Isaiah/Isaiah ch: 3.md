# Isaiah 3

**1** ¶ For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,

**2** The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,

**3** The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.

**4** And I will give children [to be] their princes, and babes shall rule over them.

**5** And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.

**6** When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, [saying], Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and [let] this ruin [be] under thy hand:

**7** In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house [is] neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.

**8** For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings [are] against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.

**9** ¶ The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide [it] not. Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.

**10** Say ye to the righteous, that [it shall be] well [with him]: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.

**11** Woe unto the wicked! [it shall be] ill [with him]: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.

**12** [As for] my people, children [are] their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause [thee] to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.

**13** The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.

**14** The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor [is] in your houses.

**15** What mean ye [that] ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

**16** ¶ Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing [as] they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:

**17** Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.

**18** In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of [their] tinkling ornaments [about their feet], and [their] cauls, and [their] round tires like the moon,

**19** The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,

**20** The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,

**21** The rings, and nose jewels,

**22** The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,

**23** The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.

**24** And it shall come to pass, [that] instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; [and] burning instead of beauty.

**25** Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

**26** And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she [being] desolate shall sit upon the ground.
