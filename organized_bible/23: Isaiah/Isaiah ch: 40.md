# Isaiah 40

**1** ¶ Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.

**2** Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD'S hand double for all her sins.

**3** ¶ The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

**4** Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:

**5** And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see [it] together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken [it].

**6** The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh [is] grass, and all the goodliness thereof [is] as the flower of the field:

**7** The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people [is] grass.

**8** The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.

**9** ¶ O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift [it] up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!

**10** Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong [hand], and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward [is] with him, and his work before him.

**11** He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry [them] in his bosom, [and] shall gently lead those that are with young.

**12** ¶ Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?

**13** Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or [being] his counsellor hath taught him?

**14** With whom took he counsel, and [who] instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?

**15** Behold, the nations [are] as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.

**16** And Lebanon [is] not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.

**17** All nations before him [are] as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.

**18** ¶ To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?

**19** The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.

**20** He that [is] so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree [that] will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, [that] shall not be moved.

**21** Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?

**22** [It is] he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof [are] as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:

**23** That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.

**24** Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.

**25** To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.

**26** Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these [things], that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that [he is] strong in power; not one faileth.

**27** ¶ Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?

**28** Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, [that] the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? [there is] no searching of his understanding.

**29** He giveth power to the faint; and to [them that have] no might he increaseth strength.

**30** Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:

**31** But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew [their] strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; [and] they shall walk, and not faint.
