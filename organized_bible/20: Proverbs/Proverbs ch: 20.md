# Proverbs 20

**1** ¶ Wine [is] a mocker, strong drink [is] raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.

**2** ¶ The fear of a king [is] as the roaring of a lion: [whoso] provoketh him to anger sinneth [against] his own soul.

**3** ¶ [It is] an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.

**4** ¶ The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; [therefore] shall he beg in harvest, and [have] nothing.

**5** ¶ Counsel in the heart of man [is like] deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.

**6** ¶ Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?

**7** ¶ The just [man] walketh in his integrity: his children [are] blessed after him.

**8** ¶ A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.

**9** ¶ Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?

**10** ¶ Divers weights, [and] divers measures, both of them [are] alike abomination to the LORD.

**11** ¶ Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work [be] pure, and whether [it be] right.

**12** ¶ The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.

**13** ¶ Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, [and] thou shalt be satisfied with bread.

**14** ¶ [It is] naught, [it is] naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.

**15** ¶ There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge [are] a precious jewel.

**16** ¶ Take his garment that is surety [for] a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.

**17** ¶ Bread of deceit [is] sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.

**18** ¶ [Every] purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.

**19** ¶ He that goeth about [as] a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.

**20** ¶ Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.

**21** ¶ An inheritance [may be] gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.

**22** ¶ Say not thou, I will recompense evil; [but] wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.

**23** ¶ Divers weights [are] an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance [is] not good.

**24** ¶ Man's goings [are] of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?

**25** ¶ [It is] a snare to the man [who] devoureth [that which is] holy, and after vows to make enquiry.

**26** ¶ A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.

**27** ¶ The spirit of man [is] the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.

**28** ¶ Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.

**29** ¶ The glory of young men [is] their strength: and the beauty of old men [is] the gray head.

**30** ¶ The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so [do] stripes the inward parts of the belly.
