# Proverbs 11

**1** ¶ A false balance [is] abomination to the LORD: but a just weight [is] his delight.

**2** ¶ [When] pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly [is] wisdom.

**3** ¶ The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.

**4** ¶ Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.

**5** ¶ The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

**6** The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in [their own] naughtiness.

**7** ¶ When a wicked man dieth, [his] expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust [men] perisheth.

**8** ¶ The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.

**9** ¶ An hypocrite with [his] mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.

**10** ¶ When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, [there is] shouting.

**11** By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

**12** ¶ He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.

**13** A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.

**14** ¶ Where no counsel [is], the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors [there is] safety.

**15** ¶ He that is surety for a stranger shall smart [for it]: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.

**16** ¶ A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong [men] retain riches.

**17** ¶ The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but [he that is] cruel troubleth his own flesh.

**18** ¶ The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness [shall be] a sure reward.

**19** ¶ As righteousness [tendeth] to life: so he that pursueth evil [pursueth it] to his own death.

**20** ¶ They that are of a froward heart [are] abomination to the LORD: but [such as are] upright in [their] way [are] his delight.

**21** ¶ [Though] hand [join] in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.

**22** ¶ [As] a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, [so is] a fair woman which is without discretion.

**23** ¶ The desire of the righteous [is] only good: [but] the expectation of the wicked [is] wrath.

**24** ¶ There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and [there is] that withholdeth more than is meet, but [it tendeth] to poverty.

**25** ¶ The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.

**26** ¶ He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing [shall be] upon the head of him that selleth [it].

**27** ¶ He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.

**28** ¶ He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.

**29** ¶ He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool [shall be] servant to the wise of heart.

**30** ¶ The fruit of the righteous [is] a tree of life; and he that winneth souls [is] wise.

**31** ¶ Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.
