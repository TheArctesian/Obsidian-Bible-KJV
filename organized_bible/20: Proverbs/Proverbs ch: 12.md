# Proverbs 12

**1** ¶ Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof [is] brutish.

**2** ¶ A good [man] obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.

**3** ¶ A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.

**4** ¶ A virtuous woman [is] a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed [is] as rottenness in his bones.

**5** ¶ The thoughts of the righteous [are] right: [but] the counsels of the wicked [are] deceit.

**6** ¶ The words of the wicked [are] to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.

**7** ¶ The wicked are overthrown, and [are] not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.

**8** ¶ A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.

**9** ¶ [He that is] despised, and hath a servant, [is] better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.

**10** ¶ A righteous [man] regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked [are] cruel.

**11** ¶ He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain [persons is] void of understanding.

**12** ¶ The wicked desireth the net of evil [men]: but the root of the righteous yieldeth [fruit].

**13** ¶ The wicked is snared by the transgression of [his] lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.

**14** ¶ A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of [his] mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.

**15** ¶ The way of a fool [is] right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel [is] wise.

**16** ¶ A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent [man] covereth shame.

**17** ¶ [He that] speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.

**18** ¶ There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise [is] health.

**19** ¶ The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue [is] but for a moment.

**20** ¶ Deceit [is] in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace [is] joy.

**21** ¶ There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.

**22** ¶ Lying lips [are] abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly [are] his delight.

**23** ¶ A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.

**24** ¶ The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.

**25** ¶ Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.

**26** ¶ The righteous [is] more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.

**27** ¶ The slothful [man] roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man [is] precious.

**28** ¶ In the way of righteousness [is] life; and [in] the pathway [thereof there is] no death.
