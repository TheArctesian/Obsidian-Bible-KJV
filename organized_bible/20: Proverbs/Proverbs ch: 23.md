# Proverbs 23

**1** ¶ When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what [is] before thee:

**2** And put a knife to thy throat, if thou [be] a man given to appetite.

**3** Be not desirous of his dainties: for they [are] deceitful meat.

**4** ¶ Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.

**5** Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for [riches] certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.

**6** ¶ Eat thou not the bread of [him that hath] an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:

**7** For as he thinketh in his heart, so [is] he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart [is] not with thee.

**8** The morsel [which] thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.

**9** ¶ Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.

**10** ¶ Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:

**11** For their redeemer [is] mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.

**12** ¶ Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.

**13** Withhold not correction from the child: for [if] thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.

**14** Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.

**15** My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.

**16** Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.

**17** ¶ Let not thine heart envy sinners: but [be thou] in the fear of the LORD all the day long.

**18** For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.

**19** ¶ Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.

**20** Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:

**21** For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe [a man] with rags.

**22** Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.

**23** Buy the truth, and sell [it] not; [also] wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.

**24** The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise [child] shall have joy of him.

**25** Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.

**26** My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.

**27** For a whore [is] a deep ditch; and a strange woman [is] a narrow pit.

**28** She also lieth in wait as [for] a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.

**29** ¶ Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?

**30** They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.

**31** Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, [when] it moveth itself aright.

**32** At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.

**33** Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.

**34** Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.

**35** They have stricken me, [shalt thou say, and] I was not sick; they have beaten me, [and] I felt [it] not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
