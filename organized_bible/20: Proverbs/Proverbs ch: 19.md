# Proverbs 19

**1** ¶ Better [is] the poor that walketh in his integrity, than [he that is] perverse in his lips, and is a fool.

**2** ¶ Also, [that] the soul [be] without knowledge, [it is] not good; and he that hasteth with [his] feet sinneth.

**3** ¶ The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.

**4** ¶ Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.

**5** ¶ A false witness shall not be unpunished, and [he that] speaketh lies shall not escape.

**6** ¶ Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man [is] a friend to him that giveth gifts.

**7** All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth [them with] words, [yet] they [are] wanting [to him].

**8** ¶ He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.

**9** ¶ A false witness shall not be unpunished, and [he that] speaketh lies shall perish.

**10** ¶ Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.

**11** ¶ The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and [it is] his glory to pass over a transgression.

**12** ¶ The king's wrath [is] as the roaring of a lion; but his favour [is] as dew upon the grass.

**13** ¶ A foolish son [is] the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife [are] a continual dropping.

**14** ¶ House and riches [are] the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife [is] from the LORD.

**15** ¶ Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.

**16** ¶ He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; [but] he that despiseth his ways shall die.

**17** ¶ He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.

**18** ¶ Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.

**19** ¶ A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver [him], yet thou must do it again.

**20** ¶ Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.

**21** ¶ [There are] many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.

**22** ¶ The desire of a man [is] his kindness: and a poor man [is] better than a liar.

**23** ¶ The fear of the LORD [tendeth] to life: and [he that hath it] shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.

**24** ¶ A slothful [man] hideth his hand in [his] bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.

**25** ¶ Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, [and] he will understand knowledge.

**26** ¶ He that wasteth [his] father, [and] chaseth away [his] mother, [is] a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.

**27** ¶ Cease, my son, to hear the instruction [that causeth] to err from the words of knowledge.

**28** ¶ An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.

**29** ¶ Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
