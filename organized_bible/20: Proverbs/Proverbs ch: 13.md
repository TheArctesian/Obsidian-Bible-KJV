# Proverbs 13

**1** ¶ A wise son [heareth] his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.

**2** ¶ A man shall eat good by the fruit of [his] mouth: but the soul of the transgressors [shall eat] violence.

**3** ¶ He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: [but] he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.

**4** ¶ The soul of the sluggard desireth, and [hath] nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.

**5** ¶ A righteous [man] hateth lying: but a wicked [man] is loathsome, and cometh to shame.

**6** ¶ Righteousness keepeth [him that is] upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.

**7** ¶ There is that maketh himself rich, yet [hath] nothing: [there is] that maketh himself poor, yet [hath] great riches.

**8** ¶ The ransom of a man's life [are] his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke.

**9** ¶ The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.

**10** ¶ Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised [is] wisdom.

**11** ¶ Wealth [gotten] by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.

**12** ¶ Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but [when] the desire cometh, [it is] a tree of life.

**13** ¶ Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.

**14** ¶ The law of the wise [is] a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.

**15** ¶ Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors [is] hard.

**16** ¶ Every prudent [man] dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open [his] folly.

**17** ¶ A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador [is] health.

**18** ¶ Poverty and shame [shall be to] him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.

**19** ¶ The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but [it is] abomination to fools to depart from evil.

**20** ¶ He that walketh with wise [men] shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.

**21** ¶ Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed.

**22** ¶ A good [man] leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner [is] laid up for the just.

**23** ¶ Much food [is in] the tillage of the poor: but there is [that is] destroyed for want of judgment.

**24** ¶ He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.

**25** ¶ The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want.
