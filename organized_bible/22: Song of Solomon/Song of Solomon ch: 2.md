# Song of Solomon 2

**1** ¶ I [am] the rose of Sharon, [and] the lily of the valleys.

**2** As the lily among thorns, so [is] my love among the daughters.

**3** ¶ As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so [is] my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit [was] sweet to my taste.

**4** He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me [was] love.

**5** Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I [am] sick of love.

**6** His left hand [is] under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.

**7** I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake [my] love, till he please.

**8** ¶ The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.

**9** My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.

**10** My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.

**11** For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over [and] gone;

**12** The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing [of birds] is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;

**13** The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines [with] the tender grape give a [good] smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.

**14** ¶ O my dove, [that art] in the clefts of the rock, in the secret [places] of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet [is] thy voice, and thy countenance [is] comely.

**15** Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines [have] tender grapes.

**16** My beloved [is] mine, and I [am] his: he feedeth among the lilies.

**17** Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
