# Song of Solomon 6

**1** ¶ Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.

**2** My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

**3** I [am] my beloved's, and my beloved [is] mine: he feedeth among the lilies.

**4** ¶ Thou [art] beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as [an army] with banners.

**5** Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair [is] as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.

**6** Thy teeth [are] as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and [there is] not one barren among them.

**7** As a piece of a pomegranate [are] thy temples within thy locks.

**8** There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.

**9** My dove, my undefiled is [but] one; she [is] the [only] one of her mother, she [is] the choice [one] of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; [yea], the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.

**10** Who [is] she [that] looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, [and] terrible as [an army] with banners?

**11** ¶ I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, [and] to see whether the vine flourished, [and] the pomegranates budded.

**12** Or ever I was aware, my soul made me [like] the chariots of Amminadib.

**13** Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.
