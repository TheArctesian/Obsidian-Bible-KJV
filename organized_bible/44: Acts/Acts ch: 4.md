# Acts 4

**1** ¶ And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,

**2** Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

**3** And they laid hands on them, and put [them] in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.

**4** Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.

**5** ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,

**6** And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.

**7** And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?

**8** Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,

**9** If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;

**10** Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, [even] by him doth this man stand here before you whole.

**11** This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.

**12** Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.

**13** Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.

**14** And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.

**15** ¶ But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,

**16** Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them [is] manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny [it].

**17** But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.

**18** And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.

**19** But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.

**20** For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.

**21** So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all [men] glorified God for that which was done.

**22** For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.

**23** ¶ And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.

**24** And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou [art] God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:

**25** Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?

**26** The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.

**27** For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,

**28** For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.

**29** And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,

**30** By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.

**31** And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.

**32** ¶ And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any [of them] that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.

**33** And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.

**34** Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,

**35** And laid [them] down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.

**36** And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, [and] of the country of Cyprus,

**37** Having land, sold [it], and brought the money, and laid [it] at the apostles' feet.
