# Acts 18

**1** ¶ After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;

**2** And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.

**3** And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.

**4** And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.

**5** And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews [that] Jesus [was] Christ.

**6** And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook [his] raiment, and said unto them, Your blood [be] upon your own heads; I [am] clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.

**7** ¶ And he departed thence, and entered into a certain [man's] house, named Justus, [one] that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.

**8** And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.

**9** Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, ‹Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:›

**10** ‹For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city.›

**11** And he continued [there] a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.

**12** ¶ And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,

**13** Saying, This [fellow] persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.

**14** And when Paul was now about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O [ye] Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:

**15** But if it be a question of words and names, and [of] your law, look ye [to it]; for I will be no judge of such [matters].

**16** And he drave them from the judgment seat.

**17** Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat [him] before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.

**18** ¶ And Paul [after this] tarried [there] yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn [his] head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.

**19** And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.

**20** When they desired [him] to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;

**21** But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.

**22** And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.

**23** And after he had spent some time [there], he departed, and went over [all] the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.

**24** ¶ And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, [and] mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.

**25** This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.

**26** And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto [them], and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.

**27** And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace:

**28** For he mightily convinced the Jews, [and that] publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.
