# Acts 28

**1** ¶ And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.

**2** And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.

**3** And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid [them] on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.

**4** And when the barbarians saw the [venomous] beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.

**5** And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.

**6** Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.

**7** In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.

**8** And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.

**9** So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:

**10** Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded [us] with such things as were necessary.

**11** ¶ And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.

**12** And landing at Syracuse, we tarried [there] three days.

**13** And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:

**14** Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.

**15** And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.

**16** And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.

**17** ¶ And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men [and] brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.

**18** Who, when they had examined me, would have let [me] go, because there was no cause of death in me.

**19** But when the Jews spake against [it], I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.

**20** For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see [you], and to speak with [you]: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.

**21** And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.

**22** But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.

**23** ¶ And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into [his] lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and [out of] the prophets, from morning till evening.

**24** And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.

**25** And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,

**26** Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:

**27** For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with [their] ears, and understand with [their] heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.

**28** Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and [that] they will hear it.

**29** And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.

**30** ¶ And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,

**31** Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
