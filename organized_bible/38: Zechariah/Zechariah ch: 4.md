# Zechariah 4

**1** ¶ And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,

**2** And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all [of] gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which [are] upon the top thereof:

**3** And two olive trees by it, one upon the right [side] of the bowl, and the other upon the left [side] thereof.

**4** So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What [are] these, my lord?

**5** Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.

**6** Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This [is] the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.

**7** Who [art] thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel [thou shalt become] a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone [thereof with] shoutings, [crying], Grace, grace unto it.

**8** Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

**9** The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.

**10** For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel [with] those seven; they [are] the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.

**11** ¶ Then answered I, and said unto him, What [are] these two olive trees upon the right [side] of the candlestick and upon the left [side] thereof?

**12** And I answered again, and said unto him, What [be these] two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden [oil] out of themselves?

**13** And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these [be]? And I said, No, my lord.

**14** Then said he, These [are] the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
