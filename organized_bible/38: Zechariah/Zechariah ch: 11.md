# Zechariah 11

**1** ¶ Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.

**2** Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.

**3** [There is] a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of Jordan is spoiled.

**4** ¶ Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;

**5** Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that sell them say, Blessed [be] the LORD; for I am rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.

**6** For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver [them].

**7** And I will feed the flock of slaughter, [even] you, O poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.

**8** Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.

**9** Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another.

**10** And I took my staff, [even] Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.

**11** And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it [was] the word of the LORD.

**12** And I said unto them, If ye think good, give [me] my price; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty [pieces] of silver.

**13** And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty [pieces] of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD.

**14** Then I cut asunder mine other staff, [even] Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

**15** ¶ And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.

**16** For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, [which] shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.

**17** Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword [shall be] upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
