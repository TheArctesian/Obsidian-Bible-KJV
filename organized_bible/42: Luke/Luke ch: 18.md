# Luke 18

**1** ¶ And he spake a parable unto them [to this end], that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;

**2** Saying, ‹There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:›

**3** ‹And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.›

**4** ‹And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;›

**5** ‹Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.›

**6** And the Lord said, ‹Hear what the unjust judge saith.›

**7** ‹And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?›

**8** ‹I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?›

**9** ¶ And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:

**10** ‹Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.›

**11** ‹The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men› [are], ‹extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.›

**12** ‹I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.›

**13** ‹And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as› [his] ‹eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.›

**14** ‹I tell you, this man went down to his house justified› [rather] ‹than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.›

**15** ¶ And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when [his] disciples saw [it], they rebuked them.

**16** But Jesus called them [unto him], and said, ‹Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.›

**17** ‹Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.›

**18** ¶ And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?

**19** And Jesus said unto him, ‹Why callest thou me good? none› [is] ‹good, save one,› [that is], ‹God.›

**20** ‹Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.›

**21** And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.

**22** Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, ‹Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.›

**23** And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.

**24** And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, ‹How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!›

**25** ‹For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.›

**26** And they that heard [it] said, Who then can be saved?

**27** And he said, ‹The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.›

**28** Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.

**29** And he said unto them, ‹Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,›

**30** ‹Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.›

**31** ¶ Then he took [unto him] the twelve, and said unto them, ‹Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.›

**32** ‹For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:›

**33** ‹And they shall scourge› [him], ‹and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.›

**34** And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.

**35** ¶ And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:

**36** And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.

**37** And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.

**38** And he cried, saying, Jesus, [thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.

**39** And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.

**40** And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,

**41** Saying, ‹What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?› And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.

**42** And Jesus said unto him, ‹Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.›

**43** And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw [it], gave praise unto God.
