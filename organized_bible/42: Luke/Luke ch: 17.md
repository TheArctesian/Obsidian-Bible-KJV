# Luke 17

**1** ¶ Then said he unto the disciples, ‹It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe› [unto him], ‹through whom they come!›

**2** ‹It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.›

**3** ‹Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.›

**4** ‹And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.›

**5** And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.

**6** And the Lord said, ‹If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.›

**7** ‹But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?›

**8** ‹And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?›

**9** ‹Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.›

**10** ‹So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.›

**11** ¶ And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

**12** And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:

**13** And they lifted up [their] voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.

**14** And when he saw [them], he said unto them, ‹Go shew yourselves unto the priests.› And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.

**15** And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,

**16** And fell down on [his] face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.

**17** And Jesus answering said, ‹Were there not ten cleansed? but where› [are] ‹the nine?›

**18** ‹There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.›

**19** And he said unto him, ‹Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.›

**20** ¶ And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, ‹The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:›

**21** ‹Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.›

**22** And he said unto the disciples, ‹The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see› [it].

**23** ‹And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after› [them], ‹nor follow› [them].

**24** ‹For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one› [part] ‹under heaven, shineth unto the other› [part] ‹under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.›

**25** ‹But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.›

**26** ‹And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.›

**27** ‹They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.›

**28** ‹Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;›

**29** ‹But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed› [them] ‹all.›

**30** ‹Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.›

**31** ‹In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.›

**32** ‹Remember Lot's wife.›

**33** ‹Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.›

**34** ‹I tell you, in that night there shall be two› [men] ‹in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.›

**35** ‹Two› [women] ‹shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.›

**36** ‹Two› [men] ‹shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.›

**37** And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, ‹Wheresoever the body› [is], ‹thither will the eagles be gathered together.›
