# Luke 7

**1** ¶ Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.

**2** And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.

**3** And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.

**4** And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:

**5** For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.

**6** Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:

**7** Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.

**8** For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth [it].

**9** When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, ‹I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.›

**10** And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.

**11** ¶ And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.

**12** Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.

**13** And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, ‹Weep not.›

**14** And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare [him] stood still. And he said, ‹Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.›

**15** And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.

**16** And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.

**17** And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.

**18** And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.

**19** ¶ And John calling [unto him] two of his disciples sent [them] to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?

**20** When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?

**21** And in that same hour he cured many of [their] infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many [that were] blind he gave sight.

**22** Then Jesus answering said unto them, ‹Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.›

**23** ‹And blessed is› [he], ‹whosoever shall not be offended in me.›

**24** And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, ‹What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?›

**25** ‹But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.›

**26** ‹But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.›

**27** ‹This is› [he], ‹of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.›

**28** ‹For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.›

**29** And all the people that heard [him], and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.

**30** But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.

**31** And the Lord said, ‹Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?›

**32** ‹They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.›

**33** ‹For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.›

**34** ‹The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!›

**35** ‹But wisdom is justified of all her children.›

**36** ¶ And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to meat.

**37** And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that [Jesus] sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,

**38** And stood at his feet behind [him] weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe [them] with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed [them] with the ointment.

**39** Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw [it], he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman [this is] that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.

**40** And Jesus answering said unto him, ‹Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.› And he saith, Master, say on.

**41** ‹There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.›

**42** ‹And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?›

**43** Simon answered and said, I suppose that [he], to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, ‹Thou hast rightly judged.›

**44** And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, ‹Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped› [them] ‹with the hairs of her head.›

**45** ‹Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.›

**46** ‹My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.›

**47** ‹Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,› [the same] ‹loveth little.›

**48** And he said unto her, ‹Thy sins are forgiven.›

**49** And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

**50** And he said to the woman, ‹Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.›
