# Numbers 13

**1** ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

**2** Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.

**3** And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men [were] heads of the children of Israel.

**4** And these [were] their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.

**5** Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

**6** Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

**7** Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

**8** Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.

**9** Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

**10** Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

**11** Of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.

**12** Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

**13** Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

**14** Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

**15** Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

**16** These [are] the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.

**17** And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this [way] southward, and go up into the mountain:

**18** And see the land, what it [is]; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they [be] strong or weak, few or many;

**19** And what the land [is] that they dwell in, whether it [be] good or bad; and what cities [they be] that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;

**20** And what the land [is], whether it [be] fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time [was] the time of the firstripe grapes.

**21** ¶ So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.

**22** And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, [were]. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

**23** And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and [they brought] of the pomegranates, and of the figs.

**24** The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.

**25** And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.

**26** ¶ And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.

**27** And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this [is] the fruit of it.

**28** Nevertheless the people [be] strong that dwell in the land, and the cities [are] walled, [and] very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.

**29** The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.

**30** And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.

**31** But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they [are] stronger than we.

**32** And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, [is] a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it [are] men of a great stature.

**33** And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, [which come] of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
