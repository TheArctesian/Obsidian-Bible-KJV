# Numbers 30

**1** ¶ And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This [is] the thing which the LORD hath commanded.

**2** If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.

**3** ¶ If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, [being] in her father's house in her youth;

**4** And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.

**5** But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.

**6** And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;

**7** And her husband heard [it], and held his peace at her in the day that he heard [it]: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

**8** But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard [it]; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.

**9** But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.

**10** And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;

**11** And her husband heard [it], and held his peace at her, [and] disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

**12** But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard [them; then] whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.

**13** Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

**14** But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which [are] upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard [them].

**15** But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard [them]; then he shall bear her iniquity.

**16** These [are] the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, [being yet] in her youth in her father's house.
