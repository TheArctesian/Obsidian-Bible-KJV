# Psalms 104

**1** ¶ Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.

**2** Who coverest [thyself] with light as [with] a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:

**3** Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:

**4** Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

**5** [Who] laid the foundations of the earth, [that] it should not be removed for ever.

**6** Thou coveredst it with the deep as [with] a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.

**7** At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.

**8** They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.

**9** Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.

**10** ¶ He sendeth the springs into the valleys, [which] run among the hills.

**11** They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.

**12** By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, [which] sing among the branches.

**13** He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.

**14** He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

**15** And wine [that] maketh glad the heart of man, [and] oil to make [his] face to shine, and bread [which] strengtheneth man's heart.

**16** The trees of the LORD are full [of sap]; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;

**17** Where the birds make their nests: [as for] the stork, the fir trees [are] her house.

**18** The high hills [are] a refuge for the wild goats; [and] the rocks for the conies.

**19** ¶ He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.

**20** Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep [forth].

**21** The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.

**22** The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.

**23** Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.

**24** O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.

**25** [So is] this great and wide sea, wherein [are] things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.

**26** There go the ships: [there is] that leviathan, [whom] thou hast made to play therein.

**27** These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give [them] their meat in due season.

**28** [That] thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.

**29** Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.

**30** Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.

**31** ¶ The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.

**32** He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.

**33** I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.

**34** My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.

**35** Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
