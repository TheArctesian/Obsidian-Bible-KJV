# Psalms 129

**1** ¶ A Song of degrees. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:

**2** Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.

**3** The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.

**4** The LORD [is] righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.

**5** ¶ Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.

**6** Let them be as the grass [upon] the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:

**7** Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.

**8** Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD [be] upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
