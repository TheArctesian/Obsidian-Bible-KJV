# Psalms 68

**1** ¶ To the chief Musician, A Psalm [or] Song of David. Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.

**2** As smoke is driven away, [so] drive [them] away: as wax melteth before the fire, [so] let the wicked perish at the presence of God.

**3** But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.

**4** Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.

**5** A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, [is] God in his holy habitation.

**6** God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry [land].

**7** ¶ O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:

**8** The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: [even] Sinai itself [was moved] at the presence of God, the God of Israel.

**9** Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.

**10** Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.

**11** The Lord gave the word: great [was] the company of those that published [it].

**12** Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.

**13** Though ye have lien among the pots, [yet shall ye be as] the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.

**14** When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was [white] as snow in Salmon.

**15** ¶ The hill of God [is as] the hill of Bashan; an high hill [as] the hill of Bashan.

**16** Why leap ye, ye high hills? [this is] the hill [which] God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell [in it] for ever.

**17** The chariots of God [are] twenty thousand, [even] thousands of angels: the Lord [is] among them, [as in] Sinai, in the holy [place].

**18** Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, [for] the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell [among them].

**19** Blessed [be] the Lord, [who] daily loadeth us [with benefits, even] the God of our salvation. Selah.

**20** [He that is] our God [is] the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord [belong] the issues from death.

**21** But God shall wound the head of his enemies, [and] the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.

**22** ¶ The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring [my people] again from the depths of the sea:

**23** That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of [thine] enemies, [and] the tongue of thy dogs in the same.

**24** They have seen thy goings, O God; [even] the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.

**25** The singers went before, the players on instruments [followed] after; among [them were] the damsels playing with timbrels.

**26** Bless ye God in the congregations, [even] the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.

**27** There [is] little Benjamin [with] their ruler, the princes of Judah [and] their council, the princes of Zebulun, [and] the princes of Naphtali.

**28** Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.

**29** Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.

**30** Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, [till every one] submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people [that] delight in war.

**31** Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.

**32** ¶ Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:

**33** To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, [which were] of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, [and that] a mighty voice.

**34** Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency [is] over Israel, and his strength [is] in the clouds.

**35** O God, [thou art] terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel [is] he that giveth strength and power unto [his] people. Blessed [be] God.
