# Psalms 131

**1** ¶ A Song of degrees of David. LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.

**2** Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul [is] even as a weaned child.

**3** Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
