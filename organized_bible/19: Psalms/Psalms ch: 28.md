# Psalms 28

**1** ¶ [A Psalm] of David. Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, [if] thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.

**2** Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.

**3** Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief [is] in their hearts.

**4** Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.

**5** Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.

**6** ¶ Blessed [be] the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.

**7** The LORD [is] my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.

**8** The LORD [is] their strength, and he [is] the saving strength of his anointed.

**9** Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.
