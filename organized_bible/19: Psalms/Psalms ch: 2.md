# Psalms 2

**1** ¶ Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?

**2** The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, [saying],

**3** Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.

**4** He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.

**5** Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.

**6** Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

**7** ¶ I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou [art] my Son; this day have I begotten thee.

**8** Ask of me, and I shall give [thee] the heathen [for] thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth [for] thy possession.

**9** Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.

**10** ¶ Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.

**11** Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

**12** Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish [from] the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed [are] all they that put their trust in him.
