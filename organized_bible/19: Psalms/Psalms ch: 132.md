# Psalms 132

**1** ¶ A Song of degrees. LORD, remember David, [and] all his afflictions:

**2** How he sware unto the LORD, [and] vowed unto the mighty [God] of Jacob;

**3** Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;

**4** I will not give sleep to mine eyes, [or] slumber to mine eyelids,

**5** Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty [God] of Jacob.

**6** Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.

**7** We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.

**8** Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.

**9** Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.

**10** For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.

**11** ¶ The LORD hath sworn [in] truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.

**12** If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.

**13** For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired [it] for his habitation.

**14** This [is] my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.

**15** I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.

**16** I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.

**17** There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.

**18** His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
