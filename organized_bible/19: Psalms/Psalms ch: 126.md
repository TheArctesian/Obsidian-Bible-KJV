# Psalms 126

**1** ¶ A Song of degrees. When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.

**2** Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.

**3** The LORD hath done great things for us; [whereof] we are glad.

**4** ¶ Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

**5** They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

**6** He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves [with him].
