# Psalms 11

**1** ¶ To the chief Musician, [A Psalm] of David. In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee [as] a bird to your mountain?

**2** For, lo, the wicked bend [their] bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.

**3** If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

**4** ¶ The LORD [is] in his holy temple, the LORD'S throne [is] in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

**5** The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.

**6** Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: [this shall be] the portion of their cup.

**7** For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
