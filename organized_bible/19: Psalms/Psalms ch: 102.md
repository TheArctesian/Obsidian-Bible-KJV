# Psalms 102

**1** ¶ A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.

**2** Hide not thy face from me in the day [when] I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day [when] I call answer me speedily.

**3** For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.

**4** My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.

**5** By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.

**6** I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.

**7** I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.

**8** Mine enemies reproach me all the day; [and] they that are mad against me are sworn against me.

**9** For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,

**10** Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.

**11** My days [are] like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.

**12** ¶ But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.

**13** Thou shalt arise, [and] have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.

**14** For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.

**15** So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.

**16** When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.

**17** He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.

**18** This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.

**19** For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

**20** To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;

**21** To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;

**22** When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.

**23** ¶ He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

**24** I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years [are] throughout all generations.

**25** Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens [are] the work of thy hands.

**26** They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:

**27** But thou [art] the same, and thy years shall have no end.

**28** The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
