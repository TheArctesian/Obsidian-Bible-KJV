# Psalms 98

**1** ¶ A Psalm. O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.

**2** The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.

**3** He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.

**4** ¶ Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.

**5** Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.

**6** With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.

**7** Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.

**8** Let the floods clap [their] hands: let the hills be joyful together

**9** Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.
