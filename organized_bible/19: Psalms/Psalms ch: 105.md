# Psalms 105

**1** ¶ O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.

**2** Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.

**3** Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.

**4** Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.

**5** Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;

**6** O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.

**7** He [is] the LORD our God: his judgments [are] in all the earth.

**8** ¶ He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word [which] he commanded to a thousand generations.

**9** Which [covenant] he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

**10** And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, [and] to Israel [for] an everlasting covenant:

**11** Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:

**12** When they were [but] a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.

**13** When they went from one nation to another, from [one] kingdom to another people;

**14** He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;

**15** [Saying], Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

**16** Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.

**17** He sent a man before them, [even] Joseph, [who] was sold for a servant:

**18** Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:

**19** Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.

**20** The king sent and loosed him; [even] the ruler of the people, and let him go free.

**21** He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:

**22** To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.

**23** Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

**24** And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.

**25** ¶ He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.

**26** He sent Moses his servant; [and] Aaron whom he had chosen.

**27** They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.

**28** He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.

**29** He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.

**30** Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.

**31** He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, [and] lice in all their coasts.

**32** He gave them hail for rain, [and] flaming fire in their land.

**33** He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.

**34** He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,

**35** And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.

**36** He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.

**37** He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and [there was] not one feeble [person] among their tribes.

**38** Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.

**39** He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.

**40** [The people] asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

**41** He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places [like] a river.

**42** For he remembered his holy promise, [and] Abraham his servant.

**43** And he brought forth his people with joy, [and] his chosen with gladness:

**44** And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;

**45** That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
