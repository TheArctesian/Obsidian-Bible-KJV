# Psalms 7

**1** ¶ Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:

**2** Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending [it] in pieces, while [there is] none to deliver.

**3** O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;

**4** If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)

**5** Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take [it]; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.

**6** Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me [to] the judgment [that] thou hast commanded.

**7** So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.

**8** The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity [that is] in me.

**9** Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.

**10** ¶ My defence [is] of God, which saveth the upright in heart.

**11** God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry [with the wicked] every day.

**12** If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.

**13** He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.

**14** Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

**15** He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch [which] he made.

**16** His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.

**17** I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
