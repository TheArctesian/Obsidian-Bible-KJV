# Psalms 109

**1** ¶ To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

**2** For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.

**3** They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.

**4** For my love they are my adversaries: but I [give myself unto] prayer.

**5** And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.

**6** ¶ Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.

**7** When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.

**8** Let his days be few; [and] let another take his office.

**9** Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

**10** Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek [their bread] also out of their desolate places.

**11** Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.

**12** Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.

**13** Let his posterity be cut off; [and] in the generation following let their name be blotted out.

**14** Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

**15** Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.

**16** Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.

**17** As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.

**18** As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.

**19** Let it be unto him as the garment [which] covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.

**20** [Let] this [be] the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.

**21** ¶ But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy [is] good, deliver thou me.

**22** For I [am] poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

**23** I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.

**24** My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.

**25** I became also a reproach unto them: [when] they looked upon me they shaked their heads.

**26** Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:

**27** That they may know that this [is] thy hand; [that] thou, LORD, hast done it.

**28** Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.

**29** Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.

**30** I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.

**31** For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save [him] from those that condemn his soul.
