# Psalms 83

**1** ¶ A Song [or] Psalm of Asaph. Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.

**2** For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.

**3** They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.

**4** They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from [being] a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

**5** For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:

**6** The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;

**7** Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;

**8** Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.

**9** ¶ Do unto them as [unto] the Midianites; as [to] Sisera, as [to] Jabin, at the brook of Kison:

**10** [Which] perished at Endor: they became [as] dung for the earth.

**11** Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

**12** Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.

**13** O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.

**14** As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;

**15** So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.

**16** Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.

**17** Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:

**18** That [men] may know that thou, whose name alone [is] JEHOVAH, [art] the most high over all the earth.
