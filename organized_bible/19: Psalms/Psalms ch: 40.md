# Psalms 40

**1** ¶ To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.

**2** He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, [and] established my goings.

**3** And he hath put a new song in my mouth, [even] praise unto our God: many shall see [it], and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

**4** Blessed [is] that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

**5** Many, O LORD my God, [are] thy wonderful works [which] thou hast done, and thy thoughts [which are] to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: [if] I would declare and speak [of them], they are more than can be numbered.

**6** ¶ Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.

**7** Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book [it is] written of me,

**8** I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law [is] within my heart.

**9** I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.

**10** I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.

**11** ¶ Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

**12** For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.

**13** Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.

**14** Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.

**15** Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.

**16** Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.

**17** But I [am] poor and needy; [yet] the Lord thinketh upon me: thou [art] my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
