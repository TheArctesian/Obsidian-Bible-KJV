# Psalms 57

**1** ¶ To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until [these] calamities be overpast.

**2** I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth [all things] for me.

**3** He shall send from heaven, and save me [from] the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.

**4** My soul [is] among lions: [and] I lie [even among] them that are set on fire, [even] the sons of men, whose teeth [are] spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

**5** Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; [let] thy glory [be] above all the earth.

**6** They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen [themselves]. Selah.

**7** ¶ My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.

**8** Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I [myself] will awake early.

**9** I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.

**10** For thy mercy [is] great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.

**11** Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: [let] thy glory [be] above all the earth.
