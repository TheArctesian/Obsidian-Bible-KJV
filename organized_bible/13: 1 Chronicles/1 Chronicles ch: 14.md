# 1 Chronicles 14

**1** ¶ Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.

**2** And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.

**3** And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.

**4** Now these [are] the names of [his] children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

**5** And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,

**6** And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

**7** And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.

**8** ¶ And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard [of it], and went out against them.

**9** And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.

**10** And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.

**11** So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.

**12** And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.

**13** And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.

**14** Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.

**15** And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, [that] then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.

**16** David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.

**17** And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.
