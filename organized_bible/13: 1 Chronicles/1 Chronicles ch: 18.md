# 1 Chronicles 18

**1** ¶ Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.

**2** And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, [and] brought gifts.

**3** And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

**4** And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot [horses], but reserved of them an hundred chariots.

**5** And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.

**6** Then David put [garrisons] in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, [and] brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

**7** And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

**8** Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

**9** ¶ Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;

**10** He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and [with him] all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.

**11** Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all [these] nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.

**12** Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.

**13** And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

**14** So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.

**15** And Joab the son of Zeruiah [was] over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.

**16** And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, [were] the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

**17** And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada [was] over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David [were] chief about the king.
