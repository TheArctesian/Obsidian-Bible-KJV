# 1 Chronicles 11

**1** ¶ Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we [are] thy bone and thy flesh.

**2** And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou [wast] he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.

**3** Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.

**4** And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which [is] Jebus; where the Jebusites [were], the inhabitants of the land.

**5** And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which [is] the city of David.

**6** And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.

**7** And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.

**8** And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.

**9** So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts [was] with him.

**10** ¶ These also [are] the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, [and] with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.

**11** And this [is] the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain [by him] at one time.

**12** And after him [was] Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who [was one] of the three mighties.

**13** He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.

**14** And they set themselves in the midst of [that] parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved [them] by a great deliverance.

**15** Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

**16** And David [was] then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison [was] then at Bethlehem.

**17** And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that [is] at the gate!

**18** And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that [was] by the gate, and took [it], and brought [it] to David: but David would not drink [of] it, but poured it out to the LORD,

**19** And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with [the jeopardy of] their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.

**20** And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew [them], and had a name among the three.

**21** Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the [first] three.

**22** Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.

**23** And he slew an Egyptian, a man of [great] stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand [was] a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.

**24** These [things] did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.

**25** Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the [first] three: and David set him over his guard.

**26** Also the valiant men of the armies [were], Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

**27** Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,

**28** Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,

**29** Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,

**30** Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite,

**31** Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, [that pertained] to the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,

**32** Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,

**33** Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,

**34** The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the Hararite,

**35** Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,

**36** Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,

**37** Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,

**38** Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,

**39** Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah,

**40** Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

**41** Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,

**42** Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and thirty with him,

**43** Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,

**44** Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the Aroerite,

**45** Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,

**46** Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,

**47** Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.
