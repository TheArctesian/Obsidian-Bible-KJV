# Lamentations 4

**1** ¶ How is the gold become dim! [how] is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.

**2** The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!

**3** Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people [is become] cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.

**4** The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, [and] no man breaketh [it] unto them.

**5** They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.

**6** For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.

**7** Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing [was] of sapphire:

**8** Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.

**9** [They that be] slain with the sword are better than [they that be] slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for [want of] the fruits of the field.

**10** The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.

**11** The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.

**12** The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.

**13** ¶ For the sins of her prophets, [and] the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,

**14** They have wandered [as] blind [men] in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.

**15** They cried unto them, Depart ye; [it is] unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn [there].

**16** The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.

**17** As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation [that] could not save [us].

**18** They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.

**19** Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.

**20** The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.

**21** ¶ Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.

**22** The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.
