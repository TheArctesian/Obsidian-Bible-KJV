# 2 Chronicles 3

**1** ¶ Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where [the LORD] appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

**2** And he began to build in the second [day] of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.

**3** Now these [are the things wherein] Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure [was] threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.

**4** And the porch that [was] in the front [of the house], the length [of it was] according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height [was] an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.

**5** And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.

**6** And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold [was] gold of Parvaim.

**7** He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls.

**8** And he made the most holy house, the length whereof [was] according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, [amounting] to six hundred talents.

**9** And the weight of the nails [was] fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.

**10** ¶ And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.

**11** And the wings of the cherubims [were] twenty cubits long: one wing [of the one cherub was] five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing [was likewise] five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.

**12** And [one] wing of the other cherub [was] five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing [was] five cubits [also], joining to the wing of the other cherub.

**13** The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces [were] inward.

**14** And he made the vail [of] blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.

**15** Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that [was] on the top of each of them [was] five cubits.

**16** And he made chains, [as] in the oracle, and put [them] on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put [them] on the chains.

**17** And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.
