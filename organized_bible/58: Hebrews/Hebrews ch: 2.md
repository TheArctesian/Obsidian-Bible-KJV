# Hebrews 2

**1** ¶ Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let [them] slip.

**2** For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;

**3** How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard [him];

**4** God also bearing [them] witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?

**5** ¶ For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.

**6** But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?

**7** Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:

**8** Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing [that is] not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.

**9** But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.

**10** ¶ For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.

**11** For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified [are] all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,

**12** Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.

**13** And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.

**14** ¶ Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;

**15** And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.

**16** For verily he took not on [him the nature of] angels; but he took on [him] the seed of Abraham.

**17** Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things [pertaining] to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.

**18** For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.
