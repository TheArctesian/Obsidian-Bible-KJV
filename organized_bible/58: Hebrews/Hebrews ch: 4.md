# Hebrews 4

**1** ¶ Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left [us] of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.

**2** For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it].

**3** For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.

**4** For he spake in a certain place of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.

**5** And in this [place] again, If they shall enter into my rest.

**6** Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:

**7** Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.

**8** For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.

**9** There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.

**10** For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God [did] from his.

**11** ¶ Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.

**12** For the word of God [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

**13** Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.

**14** Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession.

**15** For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.

**16** Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
