# Hebrews 11

**1** ¶ Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.

**2** For by it the elders obtained a good report.

**3** Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.

**4** ¶ By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.

**5** By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.

**6** But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

**7** By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.

**8** By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.

**9** By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as [in] a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:

**10** For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker [is] God.

**11** Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.

**12** Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, [so many] as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.

**13** These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of [them], and embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.

**14** For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.

**15** And truly, if they had been mindful of that [country] from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.

**16** But now they desire a better [country], that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.

**17** By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten [son],

**18** Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:

**19** Accounting that God [was] able to raise [him] up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.

**20** By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.

**21** By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, [leaning] upon the top of his staff.

**22** By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.

**23** By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw [he was] a proper child; and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.

**24** By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;

**25** Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;

**26** Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.

**27** By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.

**28** Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.

**29** By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry [land]: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.

**30** By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.

**31** By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.

**32** ¶ And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and [of] Barak, and [of] Samson, and [of] Jephthae; [of] David also, and Samuel, and [of] the prophets:

**33** Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,

**34** Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.

**35** Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:

**36** And others had trial of [cruel] mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:

**37** They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;

**38** (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and [in] mountains, and [in] dens and caves of the earth.

**39** And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:

**40** God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
