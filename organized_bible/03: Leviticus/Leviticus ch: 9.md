# Leviticus 9

**1** ¶ And it came to pass on the eighth day, [that] Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;

**2** And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer [them] before the LORD.

**3** And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, [both] of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;

**4** Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.

**5** And they brought [that] which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.

**6** And Moses said, This [is] the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.

**7** And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.

**8** ¶ Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which [was] for himself.

**9** And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put [it] upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:

**10** But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.

**11** And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.

**12** And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.

**13** And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt [them] upon the altar.

**14** And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt [them] upon the burnt offering on the altar.

**15** And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which [was] the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.

**16** And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.

**17** And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt [it] upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.

**18** He slew also the bullock and the ram [for] a sacrifice of peace offerings, which [was] for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,

**19** And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth [the inwards], and the kidneys, and the caul [above] the liver:

**20** And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:

**21** And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved [for] a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.

**22** And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.

**23** ¶ And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.

**24** And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: [which] when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.
