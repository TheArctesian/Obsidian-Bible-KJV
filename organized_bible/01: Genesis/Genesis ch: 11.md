# Genesis 11

**1** ¶ And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

**2** And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.

**3** And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.

**4** And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top [may reach] unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

**5** ¶ And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.

**6** And the LORD said, Behold, the people [is] one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

**7** Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.

**8** So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

**9** Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

**10** ¶ These [are] the generations of Shem: Shem [was] an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

**11** And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.

**12** And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

**13** And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.

**14** And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

**15** And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.

**16** And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

**17** And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.

**18** And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

**19** And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.

**20** And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

**21** And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.

**22** And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

**23** And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.

**24** And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

**25** And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.

**26** And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

**27** ¶ Now these [are] the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

**28** And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

**29** And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife [was] Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

**30** But Sarai was barren; she [had] no child.

**31** And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.

**32** And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
