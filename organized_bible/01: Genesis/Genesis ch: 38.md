# Genesis 38

**1** ¶ And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name [was] Hirah.

**2** And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name [was] Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

**3** And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.

**4** And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.

**5** And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

**6** And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name [was] Tamar.

**7** And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.

**8** And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

**9** And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled [it] on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.

**10** And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.

**11** Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren [did]. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.

**12** ¶ And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

**13** And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.

**14** And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which [is] by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.

**15** When Judah saw her, he thought her [to be] an harlot; because she had covered her face.

**16** And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she [was] his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?

**17** And he said, I will send [thee] a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give [me] a pledge, till thou send [it]?

**18** And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that [is] in thine hand. And he gave [it] her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.

**19** And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.

**20** And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive [his] pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.

**21** Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where [is] the harlot, that [was] openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this [place].

**22** And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, [that] there was no harlot in this [place].

**23** And Judah said, Let her take [it] to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

**24** ¶ And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she [is] with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.

**25** When she [was] brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these [are, am] I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose [are] these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.

**26** And Judah acknowledged [them], and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.

**27** And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins [were] in her womb.

**28** And it came to pass, when she travailed, that [the one] put out [his] hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.

**29** And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? [this] breach [be] upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.

**30** And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.
