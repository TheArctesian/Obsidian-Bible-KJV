# Genesis 14

**1** ¶ And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations;

**2** [That these] made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

**3** All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.

**4** Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.

**5** And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that [were] with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim,

**6** And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which [is] by the wilderness.

**7** And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which [is] Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.

**8** And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same [is] Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim;

**9** With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five.

**10** And the vale of Siddim [was full of] slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.

**11** And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.

**12** And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.

**13** ¶ And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these [were] confederate with Abram.

**14** And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained [servants], born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued [them] unto Dan.

**15** And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which [is] on the left hand of Damascus.

**16** And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.

**17** ¶ And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that [were] with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which [is] the king's dale.

**18** And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he [was] the priest of the most high God.

**19** And he blessed him, and said, Blessed [be] Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:

**20** And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

**21** ¶ And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.

**22** And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,

**23** That I will not [take] from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that [is] thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:

**24** Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion.
