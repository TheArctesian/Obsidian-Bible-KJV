# Genesis 9

**1** ¶ And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

**2** And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth [upon] the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.

**3** Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.

**4** But flesh with the life thereof, [which is] the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.

**5** And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.

**6** Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.

**7** And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.

**8** ¶ And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

**9** And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;

**10** And with every living creature that [is] with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

**11** And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

**12** ¶ And God said, This [is] the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that [is] with you, for perpetual generations:

**13** I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.

**14** And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

**15** And I will remember my covenant, which [is] between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

**16** And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that [is] upon the earth.

**17** And God said unto Noah, This [is] the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that [is] upon the earth.

**18** ¶ And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham [is] the father of Canaan.

**19** These [are] the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.

**20** And Noah began [to be] an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

**21** And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.

**22** And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.

**23** And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.

**24** ¶ And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.

**25** And he said, Cursed [be] Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.

**26** And he said, Blessed [be] the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

**27** God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

**28** ¶ And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

**29** And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
