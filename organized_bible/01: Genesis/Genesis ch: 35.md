# Genesis 35

**1** ¶ And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

**2** Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that [were] with him, Put away the strange gods that [are] among you, and be clean, and change your garments:

**3** And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.

**4** And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which [were] in their hand, and [all their] earrings which [were] in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which [was] by Shechem.

**5** And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that [were] round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.

**6** ¶ So Jacob came to Luz, which [is] in the land of Canaan, that [is], Bethel, he and all the people that [were] with him.

**7** And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.

**8** But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.

**9** And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.

**10** And God said unto him, Thy name [is] Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.

**11** And God said unto him, I [am] God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;

**12** And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

**13** And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.

**14** And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, [even] a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.

**15** And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel.

**16** ¶ And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.

**17** And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.

**18** And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.

**19** And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which [is] Bethlehem.

**20** And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that [is] the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.

**21** ¶ And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.

**22** And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard [it]. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:

**23** The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:

**24** The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:

**25** And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:

**26** And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these [are] the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.

**27** And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which [is] Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

**28** And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.

**29** And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, [being] old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
