# Genesis 12

**1** ¶ Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:

**2** And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

**3** And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.

**4** ¶ So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram [was] seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.

**5** And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.

**6** ¶ And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite [was] then in the land.

**7** And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.

**8** And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, [having] Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.

**9** And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

**10** ¶ And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine [was] grievous in the land.

**11** And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou [art] a fair woman to look upon:

**12** Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This [is] his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.

**13** Say, I pray thee, thou [art] my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

**14** ¶ And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she [was] very fair.

**15** The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

**16** And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.

**17** And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.

**18** And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What [is] this [that] thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she [was] thy wife?

**19** Why saidst thou, She [is] my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take [her], and go thy way.

**20** And Pharaoh commanded [his] men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.
