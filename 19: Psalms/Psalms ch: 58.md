# Psalms 58

**1** ¶ To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David. Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?

**2** Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.

**3** The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.

**4** Their poison [is] like the poison of a serpent: [they are] like the deaf adder [that] stoppeth her ear;

**5** Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.

**6** ¶ Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.

**7** Let them melt away as waters [which] run continually: [when] he bendeth [his bow to shoot] his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.

**8** As a snail [which] melteth, let [every one of them] pass away: [like] the untimely birth of a woman, [that] they may not see the sun.

**9** Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in [his] wrath.

**10** The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

**11** So that a man shall say, Verily [there is] a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
