# Psalms 144

**1** ¶ [A Psalm] of David. Blessed [be] the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, [and] my fingers to fight:

**2** My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and [he] in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.

**3** LORD, what [is] man, that thou takest knowledge of him! [or] the son of man, that thou makest account of him!

**4** Man is like to vanity: his days [are] as a shadow that passeth away.

**5** Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.

**6** Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.

**7** Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;

**8** Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood.

**9** ¶ I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery [and] an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

**10** [It is he] that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.

**11** Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand [is] a right hand of falsehood:

**12** That our sons [may be] as plants grown up in their youth; [that] our daughters [may be] as corner stones, polished [after] the similitude of a palace:

**13** [That] our garners [may be] full, affording all manner of store: [that] our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:

**14** [That] our oxen [may be] strong to labour; [that there be] no breaking in, nor going out; that [there be] no complaining in our streets.

**15** Happy [is that] people, that is in such a case: [yea], happy [is that] people, whose God [is] the LORD.
