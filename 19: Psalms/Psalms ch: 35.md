# Psalms 35

**1** ¶ [A Psalm] of David. Plead [my cause], O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.

**2** Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

**3** Draw out also the spear, and stop [the way] against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I [am] thy salvation.

**4** Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.

**5** Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase [them].

**6** Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD persecute them.

**7** For without cause have they hid for me their net [in] a pit, [which] without cause they have digged for my soul.

**8** Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.

**9** And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in his salvation.

**10** All my bones shall say, LORD, who [is] like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?

**11** ¶ False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge [things] that I knew not.

**12** They rewarded me evil for good [to] the spoiling of my soul.

**13** But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing [was] sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.

**14** I behaved myself as though [he had been] my friend [or] brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth [for his] mother.

**15** But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: [yea], the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew [it] not; they did tear [me], and ceased not:

**16** With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.

**17** ¶ Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.

**18** I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.

**19** Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: [neither] let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.

**20** For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against [them that are] quiet in the land.

**21** Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, [and] said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen [it].

**22** [This] thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.

**23** Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, [even] unto my cause, my God and my Lord.

**24** Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.

**25** Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.

**26** Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify [themselves] against me.

**27** Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.

**28** And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness [and] of thy praise all the day long.
