# Psalms 41

**1** ¶ To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. Blessed [is] he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.

**2** The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; [and] he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.

**3** The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.

**4** I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.

**5** ¶ Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?

**6** And if he come to see [me], he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; [when] he goeth abroad, he telleth [it].

**7** All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.

**8** An evil disease, [say they], cleaveth fast unto him: and [now] that he lieth he shall rise up no more.

**9** Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up [his] heel against me.

**10** But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.

**11** By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.

**12** And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.

**13** Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
