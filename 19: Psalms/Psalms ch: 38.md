# Psalms 38

**1** ¶ A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.

**2** For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.

**3** [There is] no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither [is there any] rest in my bones because of my sin.

**4** For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

**5** My wounds stink [and] are corrupt because of my foolishness.

**6** I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.

**7** For my loins are filled with a loathsome [disease]: and [there is] no soundness in my flesh.

**8** I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.

**9** Lord, all my desire [is] before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.

**10** My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

**11** My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.

**12** ¶ They also that seek after my life lay snares [for me]: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.

**13** But I, as a deaf [man], heard not; and [I was] as a dumb man [that] openeth not his mouth.

**14** Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth [are] no reproofs.

**15** For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.

**16** For I said, [Hear me], lest [otherwise] they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify [themselves] against me.

**17** For I [am] ready to halt, and my sorrow [is] continually before me.

**18** For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

**19** But mine enemies [are] lively, [and] they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

**20** They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow [the thing that] good [is].

**21** Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.

**22** Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
