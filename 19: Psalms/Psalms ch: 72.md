# Psalms 72

**1** ¶ [A Psalm] for Solomon. Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.

**2** ¶ He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.

**3** The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.

**4** He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.

**5** They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.

**6** He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers [that] water the earth.

**7** In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.

**8** He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.

**9** They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.

**10** The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

**11** Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.

**12** For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and [him] that hath no helper.

**13** He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.

**14** He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.

**15** And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; [and] daily shall he be praised.

**16** There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and [they] of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

**17** His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and [men] shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.

**18** ¶ Blessed [be] the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.

**19** And blessed [be] his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled [with] his glory; Amen, and Amen.

**20** The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
