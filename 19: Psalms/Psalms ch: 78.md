# Psalms 78

**1** ¶ Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, [to] my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

**2** I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:

**3** Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

**4** We will not hide [them] from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.

**5** For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:

**6** That the generation to come might know [them, even] the children [which] should be born; [who] should arise and declare [them] to their children:

**7** That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:

**8** And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation [that] set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.

**9** ¶ The children of Ephraim, [being] armed, [and] carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.

**10** They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;

**11** And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.

**12** Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, [in] the field of Zoan.

**13** He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.

**14** In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.

**15** He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave [them] drink as [out of] the great depths.

**16** He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.

**17** And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.

**18** And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.

**19** Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?

**20** Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?

**21** Therefore the LORD heard [this], and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;

**22** Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:

**23** Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,

**24** And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.

**25** Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.

**26** He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.

**27** He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:

**28** And he let [it] fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.

**29** So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;

**30** They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat [was] yet in their mouths,

**31** The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen [men] of Israel.

**32** For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.

**33** Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.

**34** When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.

**35** And they remembered that God [was] their rock, and the high God their redeemer.

**36** Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.

**37** For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.

**38** But he, [being] full of compassion, forgave [their] iniquity, and destroyed [them] not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.

**39** For he remembered that they [were but] flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.

**40** ¶ How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, [and] grieve him in the desert!

**41** Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.

**42** They remembered not his hand, [nor] the day when he delivered them from the enemy.

**43** How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:

**44** And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.

**45** He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.

**46** He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.

**47** He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.

**48** He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.

**49** He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels [among them].

**50** He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;

**51** And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of [their] strength in the tabernacles of Ham:

**52** But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.

**53** And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

**54** And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, [even to] this mountain, [which] his right hand had purchased.

**55** He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

**56** Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:

**57** But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

**58** For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

**59** When God heard [this], he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:

**60** So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent [which] he placed among men;

**61** And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.

**62** He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.

**63** The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.

**64** Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.

**65** Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, [and] like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.

**66** And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.

**67** Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:

**68** But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.

**69** And he built his sanctuary like high [palaces], like the earth which he hath established for ever.

**70** He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:

**71** From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

**72** So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
