# Psalms 14

**1** ¶ To the chief Musician, [A Psalm] of David. The fool hath said in his heart, [There is] no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, [there is] none that doeth good.

**2** The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, [and] seek God.

**3** They are all gone aside, they are [all] together become filthy: [there is] none that doeth good, no, not one.

**4** ¶ Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people [as] they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.

**5** There were they in great fear: for God [is] in the generation of the righteous.

**6** Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD [is] his refuge.

**7** Oh that the salvation of Israel [were come] out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, [and] Israel shall be glad.
