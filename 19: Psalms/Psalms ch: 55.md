# Psalms 55

**1** ¶ To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, [A Psalm] of David. Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.

**2** Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;

**3** Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.

**4** My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.

**5** Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.

**6** And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! [for then] would I fly away, and be at rest.

**7** Lo, [then] would I wander far off, [and] remain in the wilderness. Selah.

**8** I would hasten my escape from the windy storm [and] tempest.

**9** ¶ Destroy, O Lord, [and] divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.

**10** Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow [are] in the midst of it.

**11** Wickedness [is] in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.

**12** For [it was] not an enemy [that] reproached me; then I could have borne [it]: neither [was it] he that hated me [that] did magnify [himself] against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

**13** But [it was] thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.

**14** We took sweet counsel together, [and] walked unto the house of God in company.

**15** Let death seize upon them, [and] let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness [is] in their dwellings, [and] among them.

**16** ¶ As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.

**17** Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.

**18** He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle [that was] against me: for there were many with me.

**19** God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.

**20** He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.

**21** [The words] of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war [was] in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet [were] they drawn swords.

**22** Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

**23** But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
