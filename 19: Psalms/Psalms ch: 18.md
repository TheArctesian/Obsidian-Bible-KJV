# Psalms 18

**1** ¶ To the chief Musician, [A Psalm] of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day [that] the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said, I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.

**2** The LORD [is] my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, [and] my high tower.

**3** I will call upon the LORD, [who is worthy] to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.

**4** The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.

**5** The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.

**6** In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, [even] into his ears.

**7** Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.

**8** There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

**9** He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness [was] under his feet.

**10** And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.

**11** He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him [were] dark waters [and] thick clouds of the skies.

**12** At the brightness [that was] before him his thick clouds passed, hail [stones] and coals of fire.

**13** The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail [stones] and coals of fire.

**14** Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.

**15** Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.

**16** He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

**17** He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.

**18** They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.

**19** He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.

**20** ¶ The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

**21** For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.

**22** For all his judgments [were] before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.

**23** I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.

**24** Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.

**25** With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;

**26** With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.

**27** For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.

**28** For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.

**29** ¶ For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.

**30** [As for] God, his way [is] perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he [is] a buckler to all those that trust in him.

**31** For who [is] God save the LORD? or who [is] a rock save our God?

**32** [It is] God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.

**33** He maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], and setteth me upon my high places.

**34** He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.

**35** Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.

**36** Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.

**37** I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.

**38** I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.

**39** For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.

**40** Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.

**41** They cried, but [there was] none to save [them: even] unto the LORD, but he answered them not.

**42** Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.

**43** Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; [and] thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people [whom] I have not known shall serve me.

**44** As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.

**45** The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.

**46** The LORD liveth; and blessed [be] my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.

**47** [It is] God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.

**48** He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.

**49** Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.

**50** Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
