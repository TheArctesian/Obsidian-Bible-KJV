# Psalms 48

**1** ¶ A Song [and] Psalm for the sons of Korah. Great [is] the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, [in] the mountain of his holiness.

**2** Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, [is] mount Zion, [on] the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

**3** God is known in her palaces for a refuge.

**4** For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.

**5** They saw [it, and] so they marvelled; they were troubled, [and] hasted away.

**6** Fear took hold upon them there, [and] pain, as of a woman in travail.

**7** Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

**8** ¶ As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.

**9** We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.

**10** According to thy name, O God, so [is] thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.

**11** Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.

**12** Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.

**13** Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell [it] to the generation following.

**14** For this God [is] our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide [even] unto death.
