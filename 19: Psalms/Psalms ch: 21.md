# Psalms 21

**1** ¶ To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!

**2** Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.

**3** For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.

**4** He asked life of thee, [and] thou gavest [it] him, [even] length of days for ever and ever.

**5** His glory [is] great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.

**6** For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.

**7** ¶ For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.

**8** Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.

**9** Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.

**10** Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.

**11** For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, [which] they are not able [to perform].

**12** Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, [when] thou shalt make ready [thine arrows] upon thy strings against the face of them.

**13** Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: [so] will we sing and praise thy power.
