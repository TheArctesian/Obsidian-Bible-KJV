# Psalms 9

**1** ¶ To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David. I will praise [thee], O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.

**2** I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.

**3** When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.

**4** For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.

**5** Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.

**6** O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.

**7** But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.

**8** And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.

**9** The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.

**10** And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.

**11** ¶ Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.

**12** When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

**13** Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble [which I suffer] of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:

**14** That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

**15** The heathen are sunk down in the pit [that] they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.

**16** The LORD is known [by] the judgment [which] he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.

**17** The wicked shall be turned into hell, [and] all the nations that forget God.

**18** For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall [not] perish for ever.

**19** Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.

**20** Put them in fear, O LORD: [that] the nations may know themselves [to be but] men. Selah.
