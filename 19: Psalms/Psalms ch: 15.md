# Psalms 15

**1** ¶ A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?

**2** He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.

**3** [He that] backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.

**4** In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the LORD. [He that] sweareth to [his own] hurt, and changeth not.

**5** [He that] putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these [things] shall never be moved.
