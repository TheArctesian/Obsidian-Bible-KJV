# Psalms 106

**1** ¶ Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for [he is] good: for his mercy [endureth] for ever.

**2** Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? [who] can shew forth all his praise?

**3** Blessed [are] they that keep judgment, [and] he that doeth righteousness at all times.

**4** Remember me, O LORD, with the favour [that thou bearest unto] thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;

**5** That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.

**6** ¶ We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.

**7** Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked [him] at the sea, [even] at the Red sea.

**8** Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.

**9** He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.

**10** And he saved them from the hand of him that hated [them], and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

**11** And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.

**12** Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.

**13** ¶ They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

**14** But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.

**15** And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.

**16** They envied Moses also in the camp, [and] Aaron the saint of the LORD.

**17** The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.

**18** And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.

**19** They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

**20** Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.

**21** They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;

**22** Wondrous works in the land of Ham, [and] terrible things by the Red sea.

**23** Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy [them].

**24** Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:

**25** But murmured in their tents, [and] hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.

**26** Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:

**27** To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.

**28** They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.

**29** Thus they provoked [him] to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.

**30** Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and [so] the plague was stayed.

**31** And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.

**32** They angered [him] also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:

**33** Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.

**34** ¶ They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:

**35** But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.

**36** And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.

**37** Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,

**38** And shed innocent blood, [even] the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.

**39** Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.

**40** Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

**41** And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.

**42** Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.

**43** Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked [him] with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

**44** Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:

**45** And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.

**46** He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.

**47** Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, [and] to triumph in thy praise.

**48** Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
