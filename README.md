This was made by Jack Nathan, thank you Jack this work is incredible!

I found this from [this redit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1m2rear/i_made_a_bible_with_344000_connections/)

OPs own comments:
> I recently came across this dataset: https://www.openbible.info/labs/cross-references/ and decided to add the connections to my Bible in Obsidian. I had already separated the Bible into folders for each book and created separate files for each chapter, so all I had to do was write a script to add cross-references from each chapter, which was also quite easy once I started working on it. In the first picture, I have one book open on the left. I have the local graph opened on the right, which shows every connection to the book and chapter you are in. In the last picture, you can also see the entire connections dataset. I prefer not to keep that open, though, because it is very taxing on my computer. I'm thinking about adding a note section at some point, but I do not know yet. I take all of my notes on pen and paper, so I may start uploading scans or pictures of my notes. It will take some thinking, though, so any suggestions would be helpful.
