# Isaiah 42

**1** ¶ Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, [in whom] my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.

**2** He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.

**3** A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.

**4** He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.

**5** ¶ Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:

**6** I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;

**7** To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, [and] them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.

**8** I [am] the LORD: that [is] my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.

**9** Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.

**10** Sing unto the LORD a new song, [and] his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.

**11** Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up [their voice], the villages [that] Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.

**12** Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.

**13** ¶ The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.

**14** I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, [and] refrained myself: [now] will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.

**15** I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.

**16** And I will bring the blind by a way [that] they knew not; I will lead them in paths [that] they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.

**17** They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye [are] our gods.

**18** ¶ Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.

**19** Who [is] blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger [that] I sent? who [is] blind as [he that is] perfect, and blind as the LORD'S servant?

**20** Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.

**21** The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make [it] honourable.

**22** But this [is] a people robbed and spoiled; [they are] all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.

**23** Who among you will give ear to this? [who] will hearken and hear for the time to come?

**24** Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.

**25** Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid [it] not to heart.
