# Isaiah 33

**1** ¶ Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou [wast] not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; [and] when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.

**2** O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.

**3** At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.

**4** And your spoil shall be gathered [like] the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.

**5** The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.

**6** And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, [and] strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD [is] his treasure.

**7** Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.

**8** The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.

**9** The earth mourneth [and] languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed [and] hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off [their fruits].

**10** Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.

**11** Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, [as] fire, shall devour you.

**12** And the people shall be [as] the burnings of lime: [as] thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.

**13** ¶ Hear, ye [that are] far off, what I have done; and, ye [that are] near, acknowledge my might.

**14** The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

**15** He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;

**16** He shall dwell on high: his place of defence [shall be] the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters [shall be] sure.

**17** Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.

**18** Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where [is] the scribe? where [is] the receiver? where [is] he that counted the towers?

**19** Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, [that thou canst] not understand.

**20** Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle [that] shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.

**21** But there the glorious LORD [will be] unto us a place of broad rivers [and] streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.

**22** For the LORD [is] our judge, the LORD [is] our lawgiver, the LORD [is] our king; he will save us.

**23** Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.

**24** And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein [shall be] forgiven [their] iniquity.
