# Isaiah 12

**1** ¶ And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me.

**2** Behold, God [is] my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH [is] my strength and [my] song; he also is become my salvation.

**3** Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.

**4** ¶ And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.

**5** Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this [is] known in all the earth.

**6** Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great [is] the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
