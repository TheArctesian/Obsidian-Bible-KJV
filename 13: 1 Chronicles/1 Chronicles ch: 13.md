# 1 Chronicles 13

**1** ¶ And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, [and] with every leader.

**2** And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If [it seem] good unto you, and [that it be] of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, [that are] left in all the land of Israel, and with them [also] to the priests and Levites [which are] in their cities [and] suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:

**3** And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul.

**4** And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

**5** So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.

**6** And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, [that is], to Kirjathjearim, which [belonged] to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth [between] the cherubims, whose name is called [on it].

**7** And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.

**8** And David and all Israel played before God with all [their] might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

**9** ¶ And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

**10** And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.

**11** And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day.

**12** And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God [home] to me?

**13** So David brought not the ark [home] to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.

**14** And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.
