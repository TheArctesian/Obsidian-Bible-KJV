# Hebrews 7

**1** ¶ For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;

**2** To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;

**3** Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.

**4** Now consider how great this man [was], unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.

**5** And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:

**6** But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.

**7** And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.

**8** And here men that die receive tithes; but there he [receiveth them], of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.

**9** And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.

**10** For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.

**11** ¶ If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?

**12** For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.

**13** For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.

**14** For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.

**15** And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,

**16** Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.

**17** For he testifieth, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

**18** For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.

**19** For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did]; by the which we draw nigh unto God.

**20** And inasmuch as not without an oath [he was made priest]:

**21** (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)

**22** By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.

**23** And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:

**24** But this [man], because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.

**25** Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.

**26** For such an high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;

**27** Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.

**28** For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, [maketh] the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.
