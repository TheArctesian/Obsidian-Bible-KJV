# Exodus 2

**1** ¶ And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took [to wife] a daughter of Levi.

**2** And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he [was a] goodly [child], she hid him three months.

**3** And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid [it] in the flags by the river's brink.

**4** And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.

**5** ¶ And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash [herself] at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.

**6** And when she had opened [it], she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This [is one] of the Hebrews' children.

**7** Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?

**8** And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.

**9** And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give [thee] thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.

**10** And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.

**11** ¶ And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.

**12** And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that [there was] no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

**13** And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?

**14** And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.

**15** Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.

**16** ¶ Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew [water], and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

**17** And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.

**18** And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How [is it that] ye are come so soon to day?

**19** And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew [water] enough for us, and watered the flock.

**20** And he said unto his daughters, And where [is] he? why [is] it [that] ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

**21** And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.

**22** And she bare [him] a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

**23** ¶ And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.

**24** And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

**25** And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto [them].
