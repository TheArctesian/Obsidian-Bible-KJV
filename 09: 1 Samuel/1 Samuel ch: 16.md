# 1 Samuel 16

**1** ¶ And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.

**2** And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear [it], he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.

**3** And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me [him] whom I name unto thee.

**4** And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably?

**5** And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.

**6** ¶ And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed [is] before him.

**7** But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for [the LORD seeth] not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.

**8** Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

**9** Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

**10** Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.

**11** And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all [thy] children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.

**12** And he sent, and brought him in. Now he [was] ruddy, [and] withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this [is] he.

**13** Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.

**14** ¶ But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him.

**15** And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee.

**16** Let our lord now command thy servants, [which are] before thee, to seek out a man, [who is] a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.

**17** And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring [him] to me.

**18** Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, [that is] cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD [is] with him.

**19** Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which [is] with the sheep.

**20** And Jesse took an ass [laden] with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent [them] by David his son unto Saul.

**21** And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer.

**22** And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.

**23** And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
