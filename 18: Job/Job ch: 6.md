# Job 6

**1** ¶ But Job answered and said,

**2** Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!

**3** For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.

**4** For the arrows of the Almighty [are] within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.

**5** Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?

**6** Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there [any] taste in the white of an egg?

**7** The things [that] my soul refused to touch [are] as my sorrowful meat.

**8** ¶ Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant [me] the thing that I long for!

**9** Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!

**10** Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.

**11** What [is] my strength, that I should hope? and what [is] mine end, that I should prolong my life?

**12** [Is] my strength the strength of stones? or [is] my flesh of brass?

**13** [Is] not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?

**14** ¶ To him that is afflicted pity [should be shewed] from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.

**15** My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, [and] as the stream of brooks they pass away;

**16** Which are blackish by reason of the ice, [and] wherein the snow is hid:

**17** What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.

**18** The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.

**19** The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.

**20** They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.

**21** For now ye are nothing; ye see [my] casting down, and are afraid.

**22** ¶ Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?

**23** Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?

**24** Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.

**25** How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?

**26** Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, [which are] as wind?

**27** Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig [a pit] for your friend.

**28** Now therefore be content, look upon me; for [it is] evident unto you if I lie.

**29** Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness [is] in it.

**30** Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
