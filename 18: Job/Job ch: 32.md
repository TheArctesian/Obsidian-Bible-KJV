# Job 32

**1** ¶ So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he [was] righteous in his own eyes.

**2** Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.

**3** Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and [yet] had condemned Job.

**4** Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they [were] elder than he.

**5** When Elihu saw that [there was] no answer in the mouth of [these] three men, then his wrath was kindled.

**6** ¶ And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I [am] young, and ye [are] very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.

**7** I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.

**8** But [there is] a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.

**9** Great men are not [always] wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.

**10** Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.

**11** Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.

**12** Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, [there was] none of you that convinced Job, [or] that answered his words:

**13** Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.

**14** Now he hath not directed [his] words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.

**15** ¶ They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.

**16** When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, [and] answered no more;)

**17** [I said], I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.

**18** For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.

**19** Behold, my belly [is] as wine [which] hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.

**20** I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.

**21** Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.

**22** For I know not to give flattering titles; [in so doing] my maker would soon take me away.
