# Job 19

**1** ¶ Then Job answered and said,

**2** How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?

**3** These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed [that] ye make yourselves strange to me.

**4** And be it indeed [that] I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.

**5** If indeed ye will magnify [yourselves] against me, and plead against me my reproach:

**6** Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.

**7** Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but [there is] no judgment.

**8** ¶ He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.

**9** He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown [from] my head.

**10** He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.

**11** He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as [one of] his enemies.

**12** His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.

**13** He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.

**14** My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.

**15** They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.

**16** I called my servant, and he gave [me] no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.

**17** My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's [sake] of mine own body.

**18** Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.

**19** All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.

**20** My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.

**21** Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.

**22** Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?

**23** ¶ Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!

**24** That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!

**25** For I know [that] my redeemer liveth, and [that] he shall stand at the latter [day] upon the earth:

**26** And [though] after my skin [worms] destroy this [body], yet in my flesh shall I see God:

**27** Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; [though] my reins be consumed within me.

**28** But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?

**29** Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath [bringeth] the punishments of the sword, that ye may know [there is] a judgment.
