# Job 26

**1** ¶ But Job answered and said,

**2** How hast thou helped [him that is] without power? [how] savest thou the arm [that hath] no strength?

**3** How hast thou counselled [him that hath] no wisdom? and [how] hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?

**4** To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?

**5** ¶ Dead [things] are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.

**6** Hell [is] naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.

**7** He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, [and] hangeth the earth upon nothing.

**8** He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.

**9** He holdeth back the face of his throne, [and] spreadeth his cloud upon it.

**10** He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.

**11** The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.

**12** He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.

**13** By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.

**14** Lo, these [are] parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
