# Job 18

**1** ¶ Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

**2** How long [will it be ere] ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.

**3** Wherefore are we counted as beasts, [and] reputed vile in your sight?

**4** He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?

**5** ¶ Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.

**6** The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.

**7** The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.

**8** For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.

**9** The gin shall take [him] by the heel, [and] the robber shall prevail against him.

**10** The snare [is] laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.

**11** ¶ Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.

**12** His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction [shall be] ready at his side.

**13** It shall devour the strength of his skin: [even] the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.

**14** His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.

**15** It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because [it is] none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.

**16** His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.

**17** His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.

**18** He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.

**19** He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.

**20** They that come after [him] shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.

**21** Surely such [are] the dwellings of the wicked, and this [is] the place [of him that] knoweth not God.
