# Job 30

**1** ¶ But now [they that are] younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.

**2** Yea, whereto [might] the strength of their hands [profit] me, in whom old age was perished?

**3** For want and famine [they were] solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.

**4** Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots [for] their meat.

**5** They were driven forth from among [men], (they cried after them as [after] a thief;)

**6** To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, [in] caves of the earth, and [in] the rocks.

**7** Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.

**8** [They were] children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.

**9** And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.

**10** They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.

**11** Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.

**12** Upon [my] right [hand] rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.

**13** They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.

**14** They came [upon me] as a wide breaking in [of waters]: in the desolation they rolled themselves [upon me].

**15** ¶ Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.

**16** And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.

**17** My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.

**18** By the great force [of my disease] is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.

**19** He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.

**20** I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me [not].

**21** Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.

**22** Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride [upon it], and dissolvest my substance.

**23** For I know [that] thou wilt bring me [to] death, and [to] the house appointed for all living.

**24** Howbeit he will not stretch out [his] hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.

**25** Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was [not] my soul grieved for the poor?

**26** When I looked for good, then evil came [unto me]: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.

**27** My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.

**28** I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, [and] I cried in the congregation.

**29** I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.

**30** My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

**31** My harp also is [turned] to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
