# Job 3

**1** ¶ After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.

**2** And Job spake, and said,

**3** Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night [in which] it was said, There is a man child conceived.

**4** Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.

**5** Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.

**6** As [for] that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.

**7** Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.

**8** Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.

**9** Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but [have] none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:

**10** Because it shut not up the doors of my [mother's] womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.

**11** ¶ Why died I not from the womb? [why] did I [not] give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?

**12** Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?

**13** For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,

**14** With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;

**15** Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:

**16** Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants [which] never saw light.

**17** There the wicked cease [from] troubling; and there the weary be at rest.

**18** [There] the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.

**19** The small and great are there; and the servant [is] free from his master.

**20** ¶ Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter [in] soul;

**21** Which long for death, but it [cometh] not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;

**22** Which rejoice exceedingly, [and] are glad, when they can find the grave?

**23** [Why is light given] to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?

**24** For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.

**25** For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.

**26** I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
