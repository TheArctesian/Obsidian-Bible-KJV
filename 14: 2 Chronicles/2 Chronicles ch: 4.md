# 2 Chronicles 4

**1** ¶ Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.

**2** Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

**3** And under it [was] the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen [were] cast, when it was cast.

**4** It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea [was set] above upon them, and all their hinder parts [were] inward.

**5** And the thickness of it [was] an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; [and] it received and held three thousand baths.

**6** He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea [was] for the priests to wash in.

**7** And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set [them] in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.

**8** He made also ten tables, and placed [them] in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold.

**9** Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass.

**10** And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.

**11** ¶ And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God;

**12** [To wit], the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters [which were] on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which [were] on the top of the pillars;

**13** And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which [were] upon the pillars.

**14** He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;

**15** One sea, and twelve oxen under it.

**16** The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass.

**17** In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.

**18** Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out.

**19** And Solomon made all the vessels that [were for] the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread [was set];

**20** Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;

**21** And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, [made he of] gold, [and] that perfect gold;

**22** And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, [of] pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy [place], and the doors of the house of the temple, [were of] gold.
