# Jeremiah 48

**1** ¶ Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded [and] taken: Misgab is confounded and dismayed.

**2** [There shall be] no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from [being] a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.

**3** A voice of crying [shall be] from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.

**4** Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.

**5** For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.

**6** Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.

**7** For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity [with] his priests and his princes together.

**8** And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath spoken.

**9** Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.

**10** Cursed [be] he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and cursed [be] he that keepeth back his sword from blood.

**11** Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.

**12** Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles.

**13** And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.

**14** ¶ How say ye, We [are] mighty and strong men for the war?

**15** Moab is spoiled, and gone up [out of] her cities, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name [is] the LORD of hosts.

**16** The calamity of Moab [is] near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.

**17** All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, [and] the beautiful rod!

**18** Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from [thy] glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee, [and] he shall destroy thy strong holds.

**19** O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth, [and] say, What is done?

**20** Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled,

**21** And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,

**22** And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,

**23** And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,

**24** And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.

**25** The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.

**26** Make ye him drunken: for he magnified [himself] against the LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.

**27** For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy.

**28** O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove [that] maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth.

**29** We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.

**30** I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but [it shall] not [be] so; his lies shall not so effect [it].

**31** Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; [mine heart] shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.

**32** O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach [even] to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.

**33** And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; [their] shouting [shall be] no shouting.

**34** From the cry of Heshbon [even] unto Elealeh, [and even] unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar [even] unto Horonaim, [as] an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.

**35** Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods.

**36** Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres: because the riches [that] he hath gotten are perished.

**37** For every head [shall be] bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands [shall be] cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.

**38** [There shall be] lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein [is] no pleasure, saith the LORD.

**39** They shall howl, [saying], How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him.

**40** For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab.

**41** Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.

**42** And Moab shall be destroyed from [being] a people, because he hath magnified [himself] against the LORD.

**43** Fear, and the pit, and the snare, [shall be] upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.

**44** He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, [even] upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.

**45** They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.

**46** Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters captives.

**47** Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far [is] the judgment of Moab.
