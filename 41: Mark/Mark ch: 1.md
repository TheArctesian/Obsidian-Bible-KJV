# Mark 1

**1** ¶ The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;

**2** As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.

**3** The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

**4** John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.

**5** And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.

**6** And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;

**7** And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.

**8** I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.

**9** ¶ And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.

**10** And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:

**11** And there came a voice from heaven, [saying], Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

**12** And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.

**13** And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.

**14** ¶ Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,

**15** And saying, ‹The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.›

**16** Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.

**17** And Jesus said unto them, ‹Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.›

**18** And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.

**19** And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.

**20** And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.

**21** And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.

**22** And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.

**23** ¶ And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,

**24** Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.

**25** And Jesus rebuked him, saying, ‹Hold thy peace, and come out of him.›

**26** And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.

**27** And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine [is] this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.

**28** And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.

**29** ¶ And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

**30** But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.

**31** And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.

**32** And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.

**33** And all the city was gathered together at the door.

**34** And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.

**35** And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.

**36** And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.

**37** And when they had found him, they said unto him, All [men] seek for thee.

**38** And he said unto them, ‹Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.›

**39** And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.

**40** ¶ And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

**41** And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth [his] hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, ‹I will; be thou clean.›

**42** And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.

**43** And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;

**44** And saith unto him, ‹See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.›

**45** But he went out, and began to publish [it] much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
