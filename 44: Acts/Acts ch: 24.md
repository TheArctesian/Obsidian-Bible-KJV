# Acts 24

**1** ¶ And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and [with] a certain orator [named] Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.

**2** And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse [him], saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,

**3** We accept [it] always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.

**4** Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.

**5** For we have found this man [a] pestilent [fellow], and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:

**6** Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.

**7** But the chief captain Lysias came [upon us], and with great violence took [him] away out of our hands,

**8** Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.

**9** And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.

**10** ¶ Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:

**11** Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.

**12** And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:

**13** Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.

**14** But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:

**15** And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.

**16** And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and [toward] men.

**17** Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.

**18** Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.

**19** Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.

**20** Or else let these same [here] say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,

**21** Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.

**22** ¶ And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of [that] way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.

**23** And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let [him] have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.

**24** And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.

**25** And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.

**26** He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.

**27** But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.
