# Leviticus 11

**1** ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,

**2** Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These [are] the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that [are] on the earth.

**3** Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, [and] cheweth the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

**4** Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them that divide the hoof: [as] the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he [is] unclean unto you.

**5** And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he [is] unclean unto you.

**6** And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he [is] unclean unto you.

**7** And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he [is] unclean to you.

**8** Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they [are] unclean to you.

**9** ¶ These shall ye eat of all that [are] in the waters: whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall ye eat.

**10** And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which [is] in the waters, they [shall be] an abomination unto you:

**11** They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.

**12** Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that [shall be] an abomination unto you.

**13** And these [are they which] ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they [are] an abomination: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

**14** And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;

**15** Every raven after his kind;

**16** And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his kind,

**17** And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

**18** And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,

**19** And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat.

**20** ¶ All fowls that creep, going upon [all] four, [shall be] an abomination unto you.

**21** Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon [all] four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the earth;

**22** [Even] these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.

**23** But all [other] flying creeping things, which have four feet, [shall be] an abomination unto you.

**24** And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.

**25** And whosoever beareth [ought] of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

**26** [The carcases] of every beast which divideth the hoof, and [is] not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, [are] unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.

**27** And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on [all] four, those [are] unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.

**28** And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: they [are] unclean unto you.

**29** These also [shall be] unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,

**30** And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.

**31** These [are] unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.

**32** And upon whatsoever [any] of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether [it be] any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel [it be], wherein [any] work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.

**33** And every earthen vessel, whereinto [any] of them falleth, whatsoever [is] in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.

**34** Of all meat which may be eaten, [that] on which [such] water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every [such] vessel shall be unclean.

**35** And every [thing] whereupon [any part] of their carcase falleth shall be unclean; [whether it be] oven, or ranges for pots, they shall be broken down: [for] they [are] unclean, and shall be unclean unto you.

**36** Nevertheless a fountain or pit, [wherein there is] plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.

**37** And if [any part] of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it [shall be] clean.

**38** But if [any] water be put upon the seed, and [any part] of their carcase fall thereon, it [shall be] unclean unto you.

**39** And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

**40** And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

**41** And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth [shall be] an abomination; it shall not be eaten.

**42** Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon [all] four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they [are] an abomination.

**43** ¶ Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.

**44** For I [am] the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I [am] holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

**45** For I [am] the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I [am] holy.

**46** This [is] the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:

**47** To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.
