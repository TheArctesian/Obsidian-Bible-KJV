# Zechariah 9

**1** ¶ The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus [shall be] the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, [shall be] toward the LORD.

**2** And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise.

**3** And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.

**4** Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.

**5** Ashkelon shall see [it], and fear; Gaza also [shall see it], and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.

**6** And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.

**7** And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, [shall be] for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.

**8** And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.

**9** ¶ Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he [is] just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.

**10** And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion [shall be] from sea [even] to sea, and from the river [even] to the ends of the earth.

**11** As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein [is] no water.

**12** ¶ Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare [that] I will render double unto thee;

**13** When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.

**14** And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord GOD shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.

**15** The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, [and] make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, [and] as the corners of the altar.

**16** And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they [shall be as] the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.

**17** For how great [is] his goodness, and how great [is] his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.
