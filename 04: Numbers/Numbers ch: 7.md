# Numbers 7

**1** ¶ And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;

**2** That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who [were] the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered:

**3** And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle.

**4** And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

**5** Take [it] of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service.

**6** And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.

**7** Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service:

**8** And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

**9** But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them [was that] they should bear upon their shoulders.

**10** ¶ And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar.

**11** And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.
