# Numbers 2

**1** ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

**2** Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.

**3** ¶ And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armies: and Nahshon the son of Amminadab [shall be] captain of the children of Judah.

**4** And his host, and those that were numbered of them, [were] threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.

**5** And those that do pitch next unto him [shall be] the tribe of Issachar: and Nethaneel the son of Zuar [shall be] captain of the children of Issachar.

**6** And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, [were] fifty and four thousand and four hundred.

**7** [Then] the tribe of Zebulun: and Eliab the son of Helon [shall be] captain of the children of Zebulun.

**8** And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, [were] fifty and seven thousand and four hundred.

**9** All that were numbered in the camp of Judah [were] an hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred, throughout their armies. These shall first set forth.

**16** All that were numbered in the camp of Reuben [were] an hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty, throughout their armies. And they shall set forth in the second rank.

**17** Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp: as they encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place by their standards.

**18** On the west side [shall be] the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their armies: and the captain of the sons of Ephraim [shall be] Elishama the son of Ammihud.

**19** And his host, and those that were numbered of them, [were] forty thousand and five hundred.

**20** And by him [shall be] the tribe of Manasseh: and the captain of the children of Manasseh [shall be] Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

**21** And his host, and those that were numbered of them, [were] thirty and two thousand and two hundred.

**22** Then the tribe of Benjamin: and the captain of the sons of Benjamin [shall be] Abidan the son of Gideoni.

**23** And his host, and those that were numbered of them, [were] thirty and five thousand and four hundred.

**24** All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim [were] an hundred thousand and eight thousand and an hundred, throughout their armies. And they shall go forward in the third rank.

**25** The standard of the camp of Dan [shall be] on the north side by their armies: and the captain of the children of Dan [shall be] Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

**26** And his host, and those that were numbered of them, [were] threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.

**27** And those that encamp by him [shall be] the tribe of Asher: and the captain of the children of Asher [shall be] Pagiel the son of Ocran.

**28** And his host, and those that were numbered of them, [were] forty and one thousand and five hundred.

**29** Then the tribe of Naphtali: and the captain of the children of Naphtali [shall be] Ahira the son of Enan.

**30** And his host, and those that were numbered of them, [were] fifty and three thousand and four hundred.

**31** All they that were numbered in the camp of Dan [were] an hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred. They shall go hindmost with their standards.

**32** These [are] those which were numbered of the children of Israel by the house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of the camps throughout their hosts [were] six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

**33** But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.

**34** And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so they set forward, every one after their families, according to the house of their fathers.
