# Luke 23

**1** ¶ And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.

**2** And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this [fellow] perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.

**3** And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, ‹Thou sayest› [it].

**4** Then said Pilate to the chief priests and [to] the people, I find no fault in this man.

**5** And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.

**6** When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.

**7** And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.

**8** And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long [season], because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.

**9** Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.

**10** And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.

**11** And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked [him], and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.

**12** And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.

**13** ¶ And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,

**14** Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined [him] before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:

**15** No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.

**16** I will therefore chastise him, and release [him].

**17** (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)

**18** And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this [man], and release unto us Barabbas:

**19** (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)

**20** Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.

**21** But they cried, saying, Crucify [him], crucify him.

**22** And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let [him] go.

**23** And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.

**24** And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.

**25** And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.

**26** ¶ And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear [it] after Jesus.

**27** And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.

**28** But Jesus turning unto them said, ‹Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.›

**29** ‹For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed› [are] ‹the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.›

**30** ‹Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.›

**31** ‹For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?›

**32** ¶ And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.

**33** And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.

**34** Then said Jesus, ‹Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.› And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.

**35** And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided [him], saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.

**36** And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,

**37** And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.

**38** And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

**39** And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.

**40** But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?

**41** And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.

**42** And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.

**43** And Jesus said unto him, ‹Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.›

**44** ¶ And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.

**45** And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.

**46** And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, ‹Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit:› and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.

**47** Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.

**48** And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.

**49** And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.

**50** ¶ And, behold, [there was] a man named Joseph, a counsellor; [and he was] a good man, and a just:

**51** (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) [he was] of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.

**52** This [man] went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.

**53** And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.

**54** And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.

**55** And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.

**56** And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
