# Luke 24

**1** ¶ Now upon the first [day] of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain [others] with them.

**2** And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.

**3** And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.

**4** And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:

**5** And as they were afraid, and bowed down [their] faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?

**6** He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,

**7** Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.

**8** And they remembered his words,

**9** And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.

**10** It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary [the mother] of James, and other [women that were] with them, which told these things unto the apostles.

**11** And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.

**12** Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.

**13** ¶ And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem [about] threescore furlongs.

**14** And they talked together of all these things which had happened.

**15** And it came to pass, that, while they communed [together] and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.

**16** But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.

**17** And he said unto them, ‹What manner of communications› [are] ‹these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?›

**18** And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?

**19** And he said unto them, ‹What things?› And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:

**20** And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.

**21** But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.

**22** Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;

**23** And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.

**24** And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found [it] even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.

**25** Then he said unto them, ‹O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:›

**26** ‹Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?›

**27** And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.

**28** And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.

**29** But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.

**30** And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed [it], and brake, and gave to them.

**31** And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.

**32** And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?

**33** And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,

**34** Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.

**35** And they told what things [were done] in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.

**36** ¶ And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, ‹Peace› [be] ‹unto you.›

**37** But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.

**38** And he said unto them, ‹Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?›

**39** ‹Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.›

**40** And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them [his] hands and [his] feet.

**41** And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, ‹Have ye here any meat?›

**42** And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.

**43** And he took [it], and did eat before them.

**44** And he said unto them, ‹These› [are] ‹the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and› [in] ‹the prophets, and› [in] ‹the psalms, concerning me.›

**45** Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,

**46** And said unto them, ‹Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:›

**47** ‹And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.›

**48** ‹And ye are witnesses of these things.›

**49** ‹And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.›

**50** ¶ And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.

**51** And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.

**52** And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:

**53** And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
