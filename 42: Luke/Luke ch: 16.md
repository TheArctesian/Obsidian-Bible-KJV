# Luke 16

**1** ¶ And he said also unto his disciples, ‹There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.›

**2** ‹And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.›

**3** ‹Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.›

**4** ‹I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.›

**5** ‹So he called every one of his lord's debtors› [unto him], ‹and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?›

**6** ‹And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.›

**7** ‹Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.›

**8** ‹And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.›

**9** ‹And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.›

**10** ‹He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.›

**11** ‹If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true› [riches]?

**12** ‹And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?›

**13** ‹No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.›

**14** And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.

**15** And he said unto them, ‹Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.›

**16** ‹The law and the prophets› [were] ‹until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.›

**17** ‹And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.›

**18** ‹Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from› [her] ‹husband committeth adultery.›

**19** ¶ ‹There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:›

**20** ‹And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,›

**21** ‹And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.›

**22** ‹And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;›

**23** ‹And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.›

**24** ‹And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.›

**25** ‹But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.›

**26** ‹And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that› [would come] ‹from thence.›

**27** ‹Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:›

**28** ‹For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.›

**29** ‹Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.›

**30** ‹And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.›

**31** ‹And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.›
