# Genesis 8

**1** ¶ And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that [was] with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;

**2** The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;

**3** And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.

**4** ¶ And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

**5** And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth [month], on the first [day] of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.

**6** ¶ And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:

**7** And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.

**8** Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;

**9** But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters [were] on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

**10** And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;

**11** And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth [was] an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.

**12** And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.

**13** ¶ And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first [month], the first [day] of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.

**14** And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.

**15** ¶ And God spake unto Noah, saying,

**16** Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.

**17** Bring forth with thee every living thing that [is] with thee, of all flesh, [both] of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.

**18** And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:

**19** Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, [and] whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.

**20** ¶ And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

**21** And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart [is] evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.

**22** While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
