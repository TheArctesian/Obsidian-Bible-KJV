# Genesis 4

**1** ¶ And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

**2** And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

**3** ¶ And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

**4** And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:

**5** But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

**6** ¶ And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?

**7** If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee [shall be] his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

**8** ¶ And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.

**9** ¶ And the LORD said unto Cain, Where [is] Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: [Am] I my brother's keeper?

**10** And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.

**11** And now [art] thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

**12** When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.

**13** ¶ And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment [is] greater than I can bear.

**14** Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, [that] every one that findeth me shall slay me.

**15** And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

**16** ¶ And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

**17** And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.

**18** And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

**19** ¶ And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one [was] Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

**20** And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and [of such as have] cattle.

**21** And his brother's name [was] Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.

**22** And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain [was] Naamah.

**23** ¶ And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

**24** If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.

**25** ¶ And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, [said she], hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.

**26** And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.
