# Genesis 41

**1** ¶ And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.

**2** And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

**3** And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the [other] kine upon the brink of the river.

**4** And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

**5** And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

**6** And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.

**7** And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, [it was] a dream.

**8** And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but [there was] none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.

**9** ¶ Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:

**10** Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, [both] me and the chief baker:

**11** And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.

**12** And [there was] there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.

**13** And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

**14** Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved [himself], and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.

**15** And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and [there is] none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, [that] thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.

**16** And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, [It is] not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

**17** ¶ And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:

**18** And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:

**19** And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:

**20** And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:

**21** And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they [were] still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.

**22** And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:

**23** And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:

**24** And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told [this] unto the magicians; but [there was] none that could declare [it] to me.

**25** And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh [is] one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he [is] about to do.

**26** The seven good kine [are] seven years; and the seven good ears [are] seven years: the dream [is] one.

**27** And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them [are] seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.

**28** This [is] the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God [is] about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

**29** Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:

**30** And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;

**31** And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it [shall be] very grievous.

**32** And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; [it is] because the thing [is] established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

**33** ¶ Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.

**34** Let Pharaoh do [this], and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.

**35** And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.

**36** And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.

**37** And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.

**38** And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find [such a one] as this [is], a man in whom the Spirit of God [is]?

**39** And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, [there is] none so discreet and wise as thou [art]:

**40** Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.

**41** And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.

**42** And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;

**43** And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him [ruler] over all the land of Egypt.

**44** And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I [am] Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.

**45** And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over [all] the land of Egypt.

**46** ¶ And Joseph [was] thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

**47** And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.

**48** And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which [was] round about every city, laid he up in the same.

**49** And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for [it was] without number.

**50** And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.

**51** And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, [said he], hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.

**52** And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

**53** And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.

**54** And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.

**55** And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

**56** And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.

**57** And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy [corn]; because that the famine was [so] sore in all lands.
