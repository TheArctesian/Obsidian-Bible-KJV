# Genesis 32

**1** ¶ And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

**2** And when Jacob saw them, he said, This [is] God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.

**3** ¶ And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

**4** And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:

**5** And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.

**6** And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.

**7** Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that [was] with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;

**8** And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.

**9** ¶ And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:

**10** I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.

**11** Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, [and] the mother with the children.

**12** And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.

**13** ¶ And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;

**14** Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,

**15** Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.

**16** And he delivered [them] into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.

**17** And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose [art] thou? and whither goest thou? and whose [are] these before thee?

**18** Then thou shalt say, [They be] thy servant Jacob's; it [is] a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he [is] behind us.

**19** And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.

**20** And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob [is] behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.

**21** So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company.

**22** And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.

**23** And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.

**24** ¶ And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.

**25** And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.

**26** And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

**27** And he said unto him, What [is] thy name? And he said, Jacob.

**28** And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.

**29** And Jacob asked [him], and said, Tell [me], I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore [is] it [that] thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.

**30** And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.

**31** And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.

**32** Therefore the children of Israel eat not [of] the sinew which shrank, which [is] upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank.
