# Genesis 21

**1** ¶ And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.

**2** For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.

**3** And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

**4** And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him.

**5** And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.

**6** And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, [so that] all that hear will laugh with me.

**7** And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born [him] a son in his old age.

**8** And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the [same] day that Isaac was weaned.

**9** ¶ And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking.

**10** Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, [even] with Isaac.

**11** And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.

**12** And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.

**13** And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he [is] thy seed.

**14** ¶ And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave [it] unto Hagar, putting [it] on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

**15** And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.

**16** And she went, and sat her down over against [him] a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against [him], and lift up her voice, and wept.

**17** And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he [is].

**18** Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.

**19** And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.

**20** And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.

**21** And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

**22** ¶ And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God [is] with thee in all that thou doest:

**23** Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: [but] according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

**24** And Abraham said, I will swear.

**25** And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

**26** And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I [of it], but to day.

**27** And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.

**28** And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

**29** And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What [mean] these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?

**30** And he said, For [these] seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.

**31** Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them.

**32** Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.

**33** ¶ And [Abraham] planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

**34** And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.
