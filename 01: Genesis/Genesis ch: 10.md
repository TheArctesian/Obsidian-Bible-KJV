# Genesis 10

**1** ¶ Now these [are] the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

**2** The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

**3** And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

**4** And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

**5** By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

**6** ¶ And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

**7** And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.

**8** And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

**9** He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

**10** And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

**11** Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,

**12** And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same [is] a great city.

**13** And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,

**14** And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.

**15** ¶ And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,

**16** And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

**17** And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

**18** And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

**19** And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

**20** These [are] the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, [and] in their nations.

**21** ¶ Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were [children] born.

**22** The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.

**23** And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

**24** And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

**25** And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one [was] Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name [was] Joktan.

**26** And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,

**27** And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

**28** And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

**29** And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these [were] the sons of Joktan.

**30** And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.

**31** These [are] the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

**32** These [are] the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
